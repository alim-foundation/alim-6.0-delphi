				also supported by the following hadith: Abu Hurairah
				reported that the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace,
				used to be silent between the (opening) takbir of the
				prayer and the verbal Qur'anic recitation. Abu Hurairah
				asked him, "O Messenger of Allah, may my father and
				mother be sacrificed for you, why do you remain silent
				between the takbir and the recital? What do you say

				distance you have made between the East and the West. O
				Allah, cleanse me of my sins in the manner that a white

				Sea water's purity is based on the following hadith: Abu
				Hurairah related that a man asked the Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, "O Messenger of Allah, we sail on the
				ocean and we carry only a little water. If we use it for
				ablution, we will have to go thirsty. May we use sea
				water for ablution?" Said the Messenger of Allah, upon
				whom be peace, "Its (the sea) water is pure and its dead
				(animals) are lawful (i.e., they can be eaten without any
				prescribed slaughtering)." This hadith is related by "the
				five." At-Tirmidhi calls it hassan sahih, and al-Bukhari

		<section heading="Altered water">
			<p>
				This involves water whose form has been altered because
				of its being in a place for a long period of time, or
				because of the place in which it is located, or because
				of its being mixed with a substance that cannot be
				completely removed from it (i.e., water mixed with algae,
				tree leaves, and so on). The scholars agree that this
				type of water falls under the heading of mutlaq water.
			</p>
			<p>
				The rationale is simple: everything that falls under the
				general term of water, without any further
				qualifications, is considered pure, for the Qur'an says,
				"...and if you find not water, then go to clean, high
				ground..." (al-Ma'idah 6).

		<section heading="Used water">
			<p>
				This category refers to water which drips from the person
				after he performs ablution or ghusl. It is considered
				pure because it was pure before its use for ablution, and
				there is no basis to think that it has lost its purity.
				This statement is supported by the hadith of Rab'i bint
				Mu'wadh which describes the ablution of the Messenger of
				Allah. She states, "He wiped his head with (the water)
				remaining on his hands from his ablution." This hadith is
				related by Ahmad and Abu Dawud. Abu Dawud's version is,
				"The Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, wiped his
				head with the extra water that was in his hand." Abu
				Hurairah also reported that the Messenger of Allah met
				him alone in the streets of Madinah while he was in
				post-sex impurity. He therefore slipped away, made ghusl
				and returned. The Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace,
				asked him "Where have you been, Abu Hurairah?" He
				answered, "I was in post-sex impurity and did not want to
				sit with you while I was in that condition." The Prophet
				replied, "Glory be to Allah. The believer does not become
				impure." This is related by "the group."
			</p>
			<p>
				This is based on the rationale that since a believer
				never becomes impure, the water he uses for purification
				also does not become impure. Thus, a pure object touching
				a pure object cannot result in one's becoming impure. Ibn
				al-Mundhir said that it is related that 'Ali, Ibn 'Umar,
				Abu Umamah, 'Ata, al-Hassan, Makhul and anNakha'i said
				that if a person forgot to wipe his head while making
				ablution, it is sufficient for him to wipe his head with
				any water remaining in his beard. Ibn al-Mundhir stated
				that this proves that they took "used water" as pure.
				This opinion comes from one of the narrations attributed
				to Malik and ash-Shaf'i. Ibn Hazm ascribes it to Sufyan
				al-Thauri, Abu Thaur, and all scholars of the Dhahiri
				school of thought.

		<section heading="Water mixed with pure elements">
			<p>
				This category includes water that has been mixed with
				substances like soap, saffron, flowers, and so on, that
				is, objects considered pure by the shari'ah. Such water
				is considered pure as long as it has not been so mixed
				with other substances that one can no longer call it
				water. If this is the case, the water is still considered
				pure, but it cannot be used for purification. Umm 'Atiyah
				narrated that the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace,
				entered her house after the death of his daughter Zainab
				and said, "Wash her three or five or more times--if you
				see fit to do so--with water and dry tree leaves. For the
				final washing, use some kafoor or something from kafoor.
				When you are finished, inform me." She did so, after
				which he gave the women his outer garment and told them
				to wrap Zainab in it. This was related by "the group."
			</p>
			<p>
				The deceased should be washed with something that may
				purify a live person. Ahmad, an-Nasa'i and Ibn Khuzaimah
				record from Umm Hani that the Messenager of Allah and
				Maimunah washed themselves from one (water) container
				that had a trace of dough in it. In both of these hadith,
				we find that the water was mixed with another substance,
				but since the other substance was not substantial enough
				to alter its nature, it remained fit for consumption.

		<section heading="Water mixed with impure elements">
			<p>
				We can divide this category into two sub-categories:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The impure substance alters the taste, color or
					odor of the water. In this case, it can not be
					used for purification. According to Ibn
					al-Mundhir and Ibn al-Mulaqqin, there is a
					consensus on this point.
				</li>
				<li>
					The liquid is still considered water, meaning
					that the impure substance has not altered its
					taste, color or odor. Such water is considered
					pure and may be used for purification. This is
					based upon the following hadith: Abu Hurairah
					reported that a bedouin urinated in the mosque.
					The people stood to get him (and stop him). The
					Prophet said, "Leave him and pour a bucket of
					water or a container of water over his urine. You
					have been raised to be easy on the people, not to
					be hard on them." This hadith is narrated by "the
					group," except for Muslim.

				Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri asked the Prophet, "Can we make
				ablution from the well of Buda'ah (i.e., a well in
				Madinah)?" The Prophet, upon whom be peace, told him,
				"Water is pure and nothing makes it impure."
			</p>
			<p>
				This hadith is related by Ahmad, ash-Shaf'i, Abu Dawud,
				anNasa'i and at-Tirmidhi, who classified it as hassan.
				Ahmad said, "This hadith is sahih and Yahya ibn Ma'een
				and Muhammad ibn Hazm classified it as such." This is
				also the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, Abu Hurairah, al-Hassan
				al-Basri, Ibn al-Musayyab, 'Ikrimah, Ibn Abu Laila,
				al-Thauri, Dawud adh-Dhahiri, an-Nakha'i, Malik and
				others. Says al-Ghazzali, "I wish ash-Shaf'i's opinion
				was like Malik's."
			</p>
			<p>
				There is also a hadith from 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar in which
				the Messenger of Allah is reported to have said, "If
				there are at least two buckets of water, it will not
				carry any impurity." This hadith is related by the
				"five." However, this hadith is  mudhtarab in its chain
				of narrators and text. Ibn 'Abdul-Barr said in
				at-Tamheed, "As to the opinion of ash-Shaf'i which is
				based on this hadith, it is weak on scrutiny and is not
				confirmed by historical reports."

				Although Allah says in the Qur'an, "Verily, the idol

				from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah went out at

				was sitting by a pond. Said 'Umar, "Did a beast of prey
				drink from your pond tonight?" The Messenger of Allah
				told him, "O owner of the pond, do not inform him. It is

				the preceeding generations who used such objects for
				combs and pots for oil, and they did not see anything

				There is agreement among the scholars that these objects

				understood as a small amount of liquid) and the urine of
				an unweaned male baby are overlooked and pardoned. It is
				sufficient just to sprinkle water over the urine of an
				unweaned male baby. This is based on the hadith of Umm
				Qais. She came to the Messenger of Allah with her
				unweaned son. After a while, the baby urinated in the
				Prophet's lap. The Prophet, upon whom be peace, called
				for some water, which he sprinkled over his clothes, and
				did not give them a complete washing. This is related by
				al-Bukhari and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Ali narrated that the Messenger of Allah said, "The
				urine of a baby boy should have water sprinkled upon it.
				The urine of a baby girl is to be washed off." Says
				Qatadah, "This refers to a male baby that has not yet
				begun to eat. If he already eats, then the garment is to

				This hadith is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi

			<p>
				Sprinkling is sufficient as long as the boy is still
				nursing. If he eats solid food, his urine must be washed
				from the clothes and body. There is no disagreement on
				this latter point. Perhaps the reason for this exemption
				to the male baby's urine is that people have a tendency
				to carry their male babies around, and it would have been

				is obligatory to wash it off. If it gets on the clothes,
				it suffices to sprinkle the area with water, as it is
				very hard to be completely protected from this impurity,

				shy to do so because of my position with respect to his
				daughter ('Ali was the Prophet's son-in-law). He said,
				'Make ablution and wash your penis." This is related by
				al-Bukhari and others. Sahl ibn Hanif said, "I used to
				suffer from excessive amounts of madhi. I used to make
				lots of ghusl because of it. So I mentioned this to the
				Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, and he said, 'It
				is sufficient to take a handful of water and sprinkle it
				over your clothes wherever the fluid appears."
			</p>

				The hadith is related by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and

				considered weak when he relates in mu'an'an (handed-down)

				The hadith is related by al-Bukhari, Ibn Majah, and Ibn

				Says Ibn al-Mundhir, "Those who claim that that was

				He also says, "The scholars permit, without any

				Jallalah refers to an animal that eats the waste or flesh

			</p>

				This hadith is related by "the five," except for Ibn

				According to most scholars, alcohol is impure. Says Allah
				in the Qur'an, "Alcohol, games of chance, idols and
				divining arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork."
				Some scholars say that it is pure, for they take the
				meaning of rajis in its abstract sense as describing
				alcohol and whatever is related to it. This is not
				labeled as impure in a definite, sensory way. Says Allah,
				"Stay away from the impurities of idols." Idols are
				impure in the abstract sense, and they are considered
				impure if one touches them. The explanation of the
				preceding verse is that they are a tool of Satan, for
				they cause enmity and hatred and keep people away from
				the remembrance of Allah and pra.yer. In Subul as-Salaam
				it says, "Their origin is pure and their being prohibited
				does not mean that the object itself is impure. For
				example, hashish is prohibited but it is pure. But,
				something impure is not necessarily prohibited. Every
				impure thing is prohibited, but not vice-versa. That is
				because of the ruling that something impure cannot be
				touched under any circumstances. If a ruling says that
				something is impure, it is also prohibited. This differs
				from a ruling that something is prohibited. For example,
				it is forbidden to wear silk and gold, but they are
				absolutely pure by consensus." If one understands that,
				then the prohibition of alcohol does not necessarily 
				entail its also being considered impure: it needs some
				other evidence to prove that it is impure. If not, then
				we are left with the original position that it is pure.
				If one claims other than that, he must substantiate it.

				If a liquid falls on a person and he does not know if it
				was water or urine, he need not inquire about it. If he
				does inquire, the one who is asked need not answer him
				even if he knows that the liquid is impure. In that case,
				the person need not wash his clothes.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a person finds something moist on his body or clothes
				at night, and he does not know what it is, he need not
				smell it to discover what it might be. It is related that
				'Umar passed by a gutter (and got wet). 'Umar's companion
				asked the owner of the gutter if the water was pure or
				impure. 'Umar told the owner not to answer the question,
				and went on his way.

				Clothes that have street mud on them need not be washed.

				If a person finishes his prayer and sees some impurities
				on his clothes or body of which he was not previously
				aware, or he was aware of them but forgot about them, or
				he did not forget about them but he was not able to
				remove them, then his prayer is still valid and he need
				not repeat it. This opinion is supported by Allah's
				statement, "And there is no sin for you in the mistakes

				If a person can not determine what part of his clothes

				If a person mixes his pure clothes with his impure

					'Abdullah ibn as-Sunnabiji stated that the

					ablution and rinses his mouth, his wrong deeds
					fall from it. As he rinses his nose, his wrong
					deeds fall from it. When he washes his face, his

					head, his wrong deeds fall from it until they
					fall from his ears. When he washes his feet, his
					wrong deeds fall from them until they fall from
					beneath his toenails. Then his walking to the
					mosque and his prayer give him extra reward."
					(Related by Malik, an-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah and

					Anas reported that the Messenger of Allah said,

					and his prayer is considered an extra reward for
					him." (Related by Abu Ya'la, al-Bazzar and

					"Certainly, O Messenger of Allah." He said,
					"Perfecting the ablution under difficult

					(Related by Malik, Muslim, at-Tirmidhi and

				different ways:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Wiping all of his head. 'Abdullah ibn Zaid
					reported that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
					wiped his entire head with his hands. He started
					with the front of his head, then moved to the
					back, and then returned his hands to the front.
					(Related by "the group.").

					Wiping over the turban only. Said 'Amru ibn

					Bilal reported that the Prophet, upon whom be

					covering." (Related by Ahmad.) 'Umar once said,
					"May Allah not purify the one who does not
					consider wiping over the turban to be purifying."
					Many hadith have been related on this topic by

					scholars agree with them.

				Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said that the Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, made ablution and wiped over the
				front portion of his scalp, his turban and his socks.
				(Related by Muslim.) There is, however, no strong hadith
				that he wiped over part of his head, even though

				by using any object which removes yellow stains on the
				teeth and cleans the mouth, such as a toothbrush, and so

				Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, said, "When one of you performs ablution, he
				should sniff water up his nostrils and then blow it out."
				(Related by al-Bukhari, Muslim and Abu Dawud.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The sunnah is to put the water into the nostrils with the
				right hand and blow it out with the left. 'Ali once
				called for water for ablution, rinsed his mouth, sniffed
				up water into his nostrils and blew it out with his left
				hand. He did that three times and then said, "That is how
				the Prpohet, upon whom be peace, would purify himself."
				(Related by Ahmad and an-Nasa'i.)
			</p>
			<p>
				This sunnah is fulfilled by putting water into the mouth
				and nostrils in any way. The practice of the Prophet was
				to do both acts at the same time. 'Abdullah ibn Zaid
				said, "The Prophet would rinse his mouth and nose with
				just one hand (at one time, together). He did that three
				times." In one narration it says, "He would rinse his
				mouth and nose with three scoops of water." (Related by
				al-Bukhari and Muslim.) It is also sunnah to be plentiful
				(with water) while performing this sunnah, except if one
				is fasting. Laqit asked the Prophet, "Inform me about
				your ablution." He replied, "Complete and perfect the
				ablution and (put water) between your fingers. Use lots
				of water while sniffing it up your nostrils, unless you
				are fasting." (Related by "the five." At-Tirmidhi said it
				is sahih.)

				Anas said, "The Prophet, upon whom be peace, used to

				(1.616 cm) 3 to 5 madd (each 4 madd equals one sa'a). He

				madd." "And how much is sufficient for ghusl?" He said,
				"One sa'a." The man said, "That is not sufficient for

				Extravagance is to use water without any benefit, like

				that one who has a minor defilement may not touch the

				"...which none touches save the purified," (alWaqi'ah

				Wiping over the socks is part of the sunnah. An-Nawawi
				states, "All those who qualify for ijma' (consensus)
				agree that it is allowed to wipe over the socks--during
				travelling or at home, if needed or not--even a woman who
				stays at home or a handicapped person who cannot walk can
				do so. The Shi'ah and Khawarij reject it, but their
				rejection is not valid. Says Ibn Hajr in Fath al-Bari,
				"All of the preservers (of hadith) are of the opinion
				that wiping over the socks has come through a continuous
				transmission. Some have collected all of its narrations
				(from among the companions), and its number exceeds
				eighty. This includes hadith from the ten pepole who were
				promised Paradise." The strongest hadith on this point
				has been related by Ahmad, al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud
				and at-Tirmidhi on the authority of Hammam anNakha'i who
				said, "Jarir ibn 'Abdullah urinated, performed ablution
				and wiped over his socks." It was said to him, "You do
				that and you have urinated?" He said, "Yes, I saw the
				Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, urinate and then
				do likewise." Said Ibrahim, "They were amazed at that
				hadith, because Jarir had embraced Islam after surah
				al-Ma'idah was revealed (10 AH). One of its verses calls
				for washing one's feet. This hadith helps us understand
				the verse by confining it to one who is not wearing
				socks. This constitutes a particular case, and the person
				who wears socks can just wipe over them.

				It is allowed to wipe over slippers, as this has been
				related from many companions. Says Abu Dawud, "Wiping
				over sandals (has been done by) 'Ali ibn Abu Talib, Ibn
				Mas'ud, al-Barra' ibn 'Aazib, Anas ibn Malik, Abu Umamah,
				Sahl ibn Sa'd and 'Amr ibn Hareeth. It has also been
				related from 'Umar ibn al-Khattab and Ibn 'Abbas."
				'Ammar, Bilal ibn 'Abdullah ibn Abu Aufi and Ibn 'Umar
				also have hadith on this subejct. In Ibn alQayyim's
				Tahdhib as-Sunan, he relates from Ibn al-Mundhir, "Ahmad
				made a statement about the permissibility of wiping over
				slippers because of his fairness and justice.
				Nevertheless, the basis of this permissibility is the
				practice of the companions and a manifest analogy. There
				is no real difference between socks and slippers. It is
				correct that they take the same ruling. Most scholars say
				that one can wipe over either one." Those who permit it
				include Sufyan al-Thauri, Ibn al-Mubarak, 'Ata, al-Hasan
				and Sa'eed ibn alMusayyab. Commenting on this subject,
				Abu Yusuf and Muhammad said, "It is allowed to wipe over
				them if they are thick and completely hide what they
				cover."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah did not approve of wiping over thick
				slippers, but he changed his mind three or seven days
				before his death. He wiped over his slippers during his
				illness and said to his visitors, "I did what I used to
				tell people not to do." Al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah reported
				that the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, made
				ablution and wiped over his socks and slippers. This is
				related by Ahmad, at-Tahawi, Ibn Majah and at-Tirmidhi,

			</p>
			<p>
				As it is permissible to wipe over socks so is it
				permissible to wipe over any foot covering, which has
				been used to avoid the cold or protect the wound, and so
				on. Of its permissibility, Ibn Taimiyyah says, "It is all
				right to wipe over foot covering because it takes
				precedence over wiping socks or slippers, for usually a
				foot covering is used for some need and to protect the
				feet from some harm. If wiping over the socks and
				slippers is allowed, then wiping over any foot covering
				should come first. Whoever claims that there is a
				consensus on the inadmissibility of wiping over foot
				coverings does so with a lack of knowledge. Not to speak
				of a consensus, he cannot prove its forbiddance even from
				the works of ten famous scholars." He goes on to say,
				"Whoever ponders over the words of the Messenger of
				Allah, upon whom be peace, and gives analogy its proper
				place, will know that the license from him was spacious
				on this subject and in accord with the beauty of Islamic
				law and the monotheistic magnanimity with which the
				Prophet had been sent." Even if there are some holes or
				cuts in the socks, it is permissible to wipe over them,
				as long as the person has only such socks to wear. Says
				al-Thauri, "The slippers of the emigrants and helpers
				were not free of cuts or holes, like the slippers of the
				people (in general). If this were a matter of concern, it
				would have been mentioned and related by them."

				This refers to the penis and the vagina. If one's penis

				impurity refers to any type of sexual intercourse,
				regardless of whether sperm was ejaculated or not. If
				someone says, 'So and so is sexually impure due to so and
				so,'  it refers to any type of sexual intercourse between

				The companions were all agreed that it is forbidden to

				who allow the physically unclean person, whether because
				of sex or menstruation, to touch or carry the Qur'an, and
				they see nothing wrong with this. He derives his support
				from a hadith in the two Sahihs in which it is stated
				that the Prophet sent a letter to Heraclius saying, "In

				people of the book, come to a statement that is common

				Allah. If they turn away, then say 'Bear witness that we
				are they who have surrendered (unto Him)." (al'Imran 64).
				Ibn Hazm concludes, "This is the letter the Messenger of
				Allah wrote, containing this verse, to the Christians,
				and of course they touched it." The majority of scholars
				answer him by stating that one is allowed to touch parts

				According to most scholars, one who is physically unclean
				(because of sex or menstruation) may not recite any
				portion of the Qur'an. This is based on a hadith from
				'Ali, in which he stated that nothing kept the Messenger
				of Allah, upon whom be peace, from the Qur'an save being
				sexually impure. This is  related by "the four."
				At-Tirmidhi graded it sahih. Says al-Hafez in al-Fath,
				"Some people declare some of its narrators weak. But, in
				fact, it is of the hassan class and it is satisfactory as
				a proof." He also related, "I saw the Messenger of Allah
				perform ablution and recite some of the Qur'an, after
				which he said, 'This is for the one who is not in
				post-sex impurity. If one is in post-sex impurity, he may
				not do so, not even one verse." Ahmad and Abu Ya'la
				related this hadith with that wording. With that wording,
				al-Haithami says, "Its narrators are trustworthy." Says
				ash-Shaukani, "If that (report) is authentic, that is
				proof enough that it is forbidden." The first hadith does
				not forbid it, for it just states that it was his
				practice not to recite the Qur'an while he was in
				post-sex impurity. Similar reports do not show that it is
				disliked. Therefore, how can it be used as a proof that
				it is forbidden?" Al-Bukhari, at-Tabarani, Dawud, and Ibn
				Hazm are of the opinion that it is permissible for one
				who is in post-sex impurity (or in menstruation) to
				recite the Qur'an. Says al-Bukhari, "Ibrahim said, 'There
				is no problem if a menstruating woman recites a verse.'
				Ibn 'Abbas did not see anything wrong with a sexually
				impure person reciting the Qur'an. The Prophet, upon whom

				In Ibn Hajr's notes to that work, he says, "There is no
				authentic hadith reported by the author (al-Bukhari)
				concerning the prohibition of reciting by one who is
				sexually impure or menstruating." The sum total of what

				It is forbidden for one who is physically unclean
				(because of sex or menstruation) to stay in the mosque.
				'Aishah said, "The Messenger of Allah, upon whom be

				in the mosque. He said, 'Direct those houses away from
				the mosque.' He then entered the mosque, but the people
				did nothing, hoping that Allah would reveal to Muhammad
				that what they were doing was permissible. After he came

				Umm Salamah related that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				came to the mosque's courtyard and said at the top of his
				voice, "The mosque is off limits to menstruating women
				and the sexually impure persons." (Related by Ibn Majah
				and at-Tabarani.) Such people can, however, pass through
				the mosque, for says Allah, "O you who believe, draw not
				near unto prayer when you are drunk until you know that
				which you utter, nor when you are impure save when
				journeying upon the road, until you have bathed"
				(an-Nisa' 43). Said Jubair, "One of us used to pass

		<section heading="Before the Friday prayer">
			<p>
				Muslims are encouraged to perform ghusl before they
				gather for the Friday prayer. In fact, Islamic law even
				goes to the extent of ordering one to perform ghusl at
				this time as part of the overall cleanliness and hygiene
				of the Muslim society. Abu Sa'eed reported that the
				Prophet said,"Ghusl on Friday is obligatory (wajib) on
				every adult, as is using a toothbrush and applying some
				perfume." (Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The meaning of "obligatory" here is that it is greatly
				recommended. This understanding of the Prophet's saying
				is derived from what al-Bukhari recorded about an
				incident from Ibn 'Umar about his father. One day, 'Umar
				ibn al-Khattab was standing and delivering the khutbah
				when 'Uthman, one of the people from among the emigrants
				and helpers, entered. 'Umar said to him, "What time is it
				now?" He said, "I was busy and could not return home.
				When I heard the call to prayer, I did not make more than
				the regular ablution." 'Umar said, "And the ablution
				only, when you know that the Messenger of Allah ordered
				us to perform ghusl ?" Commenting on the incident, says
				ash-Shaf'i, " 'Uthman did not leave the prayer to perform
				ghusl, nor did 'Umar order him to do so. This illustrates
				that the companions knew that this order was one of
				choice. It also shows that it is preferred."
			</p>
			<p>
				Muslim recorded that Abu Hurairah reported the Prophet
				saying, "Whoever makes the ablution and perfects it and
				then goes to the Friday prayer and listens attentively,
				will have forgiveness during (the period) between the
				Friday and the next (Friday), and an additional three
				days." Says al-Qurtubi, "This hadith shows that ghusl is
				preferred. The mention of ablution, the reward and
				acceptability points to the fact that ablution alone is
				sufficient.'' Ibn Hajr states in at-Talkhis, "It is one
				of the strongest proofs that ghusl for the Friday prayer
				is not obligatory. The statement that it is preferred is
				built upon the fact that if one does not perform ghusl,
				it will not harm (his prayer). But, if others are harmed
				by his perspiration or bad smell from his clothes and
				body, ghusl becomes obligatory, and not performing it
				detracts from the rewards of salah. Some scholars say
				that the Friday ghusl is a duty even if its
				non-performance causes no harm (to others). Their basis
				for this opinion is the hadith related by Abu Hurairah in
				which the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, "It is a
				duty upon every Muslim to perform ghusl once every seven
				days, by washing his head and body." Al-Bukhari and
				Muslim accept the hadith mentioned on the subject in
				their apparent meanings, and refute the ones contrary to
				the last hadith (of Abu Hurairah).
			</p>
			<p>
				The time for the Friday ghusl is between dawn and the
				time of the Friday prayer. It is preferable to do it at
				the time of departure (to the mosque). If one loses his
				ablution after that, it is sufficient for him just to
				make a new ablution (he does not have to repeat the
				ghusl).
			</p>
			<p>
				Says al-Athram, "I heard Ahmad being asked if a person
				performed ghusl, and then lost it, would the regular
				ablution be sufficient for him. He said, 'Yes, and I have
				not heard anything about that preferable to the hadith of
				Ibn 'Abzi," Ahmad is referring to the hadith related by
				Ibn 'Abzi Shaibah (with a sahih chain from 'Abdurahman
				ibn 'Abzi on the authority of his father, who was a
				companion.)He performed ghusl for the Friday prayer, and
				afterwards nullified his ablution. After that, he
				performed just the regular ablution, and did not repeat
				his ghusl. The time for the ghusl ends with the time of
				the prayer. If one performs ghusl after the prayer, it
				would not be the ghusl of the Friday prayer, and one who
				does so is not following the Prophet's order. Ibn 'Umar
				reported that the Prophet said, "Before you come to the
				Friday prayer, you should perform ghusl. (Related by "the
				group.") Muslim says, "When one of you wants to come to
				the Friday prayer, he should perform ghusl." Ibn
				'Abdul-Barr related that there is a consensus on this

				"Whoever has washed a corpse must perform ghusl, and
				whoever carried him must perform ablution." (Related by

				others.) However, there is some criticism of this hadith.
				'Ali ibn al-Madani, Ahmad, Ibn al-Mundhir, ar-Rafi' and
				others say, "The hadith scholars did not classify
				anything on this topic as authentic." But Ibn Hajr quotes
				at-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban: "At-Tirmidhi called it hassan

				chains of the hadith that the jurists argue by." The
				order in the hadith implies preference, based on what has
				been related by 'Umar, who said, "We used to wash the
				dead. Some of us would perform ghusl and some would not."
				(Related by al-Khateeb with a sahih chain.) When 'Asma

				It is sufficient to perform one ghusl for both
				menstruation and sexual impurity, or for the Friday
				prayer and the 'id prayer, or for sexual impurity and the
				Friday prayer, if one has the intention for both of them.
				This is based on the Prophet's saying, "All acts are
				based on intentions."
			</p>
			<p>
				If a person performed post-sex ghusl but did not make
				ablution, the ghusl will suffice. Said 'Aishah, "The
				Messenger of Allah did not perform ablution after ghusl."
				Ibn 'Umar said to a man who had told him that he
				performed ablution after ghusl, "You went too far." Says
				Abu Bakr ibn al-'Arabi, "There is no difference of
				opinion among the scholars that ablution falls under the
				category of ghusl. If the intention was to remove sexual
				impurity, it also includes the minor impurities, as what
				sexual impurity prevents is greater than what the minor
				impurities prevent. The smaller one falls under the
				greater one, and the intention for the greater one
				suffices.''
			</p>
			<p>
				It is acceptable for a person in post-sex uncleanliness
				or a menstruating woman to remove their hairs, cut their
				nails, go to the markets, and so on, without any dislike.
				'Ata said that such people can get cupped, cut their
				nails and their hair, and that this is allowed even if he
				(or she) has not performed the regular ablution. (Related
				by al-Bukhari).
			</p>
			<p>
				One may enter a public bathroom. As long as he keeps his
				private parts from being seen, and he does not look at
				others' private parts. Says Ahmad, "If you know that
				everyone inside the bathroom is wearing a loincloth, you
				may enter. If not, then don't enter." The Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, said, "A man should not look at another
				man's private parts, and a woman should not look at
				another woman's private parts." There is no problem with
				mentioning Allah's name in the public baths, as
				mentioning the name of Allah under any circumstances is
				good, since there is no text prohibiting it. The
				Messenger of Allah used to remember Allah under all
				circumstances.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no problem in drying one's self with a towel or
				other cloth after performing ablution or ghusl during the
				summer or winter.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is permissible for a man to use the water left over by
				a woman and vice-versa. This is derived from the fact
				that it is permissible for them to perform ghusl from the
				same container. Ibn 'Abbas narrated that some of the
				Prophet's wives were performing ghusl from a container.
				The Prophet came and performed his ablution or ghusl from
				it. They said to him, "We were sexually unclean." He
				said, "The water does not become impure." (Related by
				Ahmad, Abu Dawud, an-Nasa'i and at-Tirmidhi, who called
				it hassan sahih). 'Aishah used to wash with the Messenger
				of Allah from one container, and they would take turns
				taking water until he said, "Leave some for me, leave
				some for me."
			</p>
			<p>
				It is not allowed to bathe in the nude in front of
				people. It is forbidden to uncover one's private parts.
				If you cover it with some clothes, it is permissible. The
				Messenger of Allah would cover Fatimah with a curtain
				when she performed ghusl. If one performs ghusl in the
				nude, far away from the people, it is not prohibited. The
				prophets Musa (Moses) and Ayyub (Job) did so, as
				al-Bukhari, Ahmad, and an-Nasa'i recorded.

				First, one must have the intention (see the section on

		<section heading="What nullifies tayammum">
			<p>
				In addition to the presence of water, everything that
				nullifies the ablution nullifies tayammum. If a person
				prays after performing tayammum and then finds water, he
				does not need to repeat his prayer even if there is time
				left to do so. Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri said, "Two men went
				out on a journey. The time of prayer came and, as they
				had no water, they performed tayammum. Then they found
				some water during the time of the same prayer. One of
				them repeated his prayer with ablution and the other did
				not. When they saw the Messenger of Allah, they asked him
				about the proper procedure in such a case. He said to the
				one who did not repeat his prayer, 'You have acted
				according to the sunnah and your prayer is sufficient for
				you.' He said to the other, 'You will get a double
				reward."' (Related by Abu Dawud and anNasa'i.) If one
				comes across water before he prays or finishes his prayer
				with tayammum, his prayer becomes null and void, for he
				must make ablution with water. If a person is not clean
				because of sex or a wet dream, or a woman is
				menstruating, and they pray after performing tayammum,
				they need not repeat their prayer after finding water,
				but they must perform ghusl with water when they can.
				'Umar said, "The Prophet led the people in prayer, and
				afterwards saw a man who had not prayed. He said, 'Why
				didn't you pray with us?' The man replied, 'I was
				sexually unclean and there was no water.' He told him,
				'Use the soil, and it will be enough.' 'Imran then

		<section heading="Wiping Over Casts, Wrappers and Similar Items">
			<p>
				It is allowable to wipe over any wrapper or diseased or
				injured bodily part. There are many hadith on this point,
				and although they are all weak, their many chains
				strengthen each other, making them valid to talk about.
				One hadith, that of Jabir (quoted earlier), relates a
				story about a man who was on a journey and suffered an
				injury. While he slept, he had a wet dream, after which
				he asked his companions if he could perform tayammum.
				They said he could not, so he made ghusl and died because
				of it. When that was mentioned to the Prophet, he said
				"They killed him, may Allah kill them. Do you not ask
				about what you do not know? ... It would have been enough
				for him to perform tayammum and drop a little water over
				his wound or else wipe it, then to wipe it and wash the
				rest of the body." This is related by Abu Dawud, Ibn
				Majah, ad-Daraqutni and Ibn as-Sakin, who classified it
				as sahih. Ibn 'Umar used to do this.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, it is obligatory to wipe over such casts or
				wrappers in ablution or ghusl instead of washing the
				injured parts. This must be done even if he has to heat
				the water. But, if he believes that this would harm the
				diseased or injured part, or that his condition may
				worsen, or that his pain would increase, he may wipe the
				injured part with water. If he fears that this would also
				be harmful, he should wrap it and then gently wipe over
				it. It is not necessary for him to be in a state of
				purity while applying the cast or wrapper to be wiped.
				There is also no time limit for such wipings, for he can
				do so as long as his condition lasts. Removing the
				wrapper or cast nullifies the wiping, as does the final
				cure.

				at such times and go not in unto them until they are
				cleaned. And when they have purified themselves, then go
				in unto them as Allah has enjoined upon you. Truly, Allah
				loves those who turn unto Him and loves those who have a
				care for cleanliness" (al-Baqarah 222). The Messenger of
				Allah also said, "Do everything except intercourse."
				(Related by "the group," except for al-Bukhari.)
			</p>
			<p>
				In his comments on the subject, an-Nawawi states, "If a
				Muslim believes it is permissible to have intercourse
				with his menstruating wife, he becomes an unbelieving
				apostate. If he does it, not thinking that it is
				permissible, but out of forgetfulness or not knowing that
				it is forbidden or not knowing that his wife was
				menstruating, then there is no sin or expiation upon him.
				If he does it on purpose, knowing that it is forbidden,
				he has committed a grave sin and must repent. There are
				two opinions on this: the more correct one is that there
				is to be expiation." He further says, "All scholars say
				that one may touch anything above the navel or below the
				knees. Most scholars say that it is permissible to touch
				what is between the navel and the knees, but not the
				vagina or anus." An-Nawawi concludes that it is permitted
				but hated, as that is the strongest position from the
				evidence . This evidence is based upon the practice of
				the Prophet's wives: when he wished to be with them
				during their period, they would put something over their
				vagina. (Related by Abu Dawud.) Al-Hafez observes, "Its
				chain is strong." Masruq ibn al-Ajda' asked 'Aishah,
				"What is off limits to me sexually during my wife's
				menstruation?" She said, "Nothing, except the vagina."

		<section heading="Women with Prolonged Flows of Blood">
			<p>
				Islam defines such an occurrence as the flowing of blood
				outside of the regular time. This usually happens in
				three specific cases. In the first case, the woman knows
				that her flow of menstrual blood is lasting longer than
				usual. In such a case, she will act according to her
				customary period, and the remainder will be considered
				days of prolonged blood flows. This is based on the
				hadith of Umm Salamah, in which she asked the Messenger
				of Allah, upon whom be peace, about this condition. He
				said, "She should wait for the days and nights of her
				normal period and figure them out of the month, and she
				should leave the prayer during those days. (Afterwards)
				she should perform ghusl, tighten something around her
				vagina and then pray." (Related by Malik, ash-Shafi and
				"the five," except for at-Tirmidhi.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Evaluating the report, an-Nawawi says, "Its chain meets
				the conditions (of al-Bukhari and Muslim)." Al-Khattabi
				holds, "That regulation is for the woman who is
				experiencing prolonged blood flows. If the blood is
				flowing, the Prophet ordered her to leave the prayer
				during her regular period, and to perform ghusl after her
				customary time has passed. Then, she becomes just like
				any other purified person."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second case, a woman does not know her period well
				enough to determine if she is experiencing menstrual
				bleeding or a prolonged flow of blood. In that case, her
				menstruation is considered to be six or seven days, which
				is the most common among women.
			</p>
			<p>
				Said Jamnah bint Jahsh, "I had a very strong prolonged
				flow of blood. I went to the Prophet to ask him about it.
				When I asked him if I had to stop praying and fasting, he
				said 'Tie around a cloth, and it will stop.' I said, 'It
				is greater than that.' He said, 'Curb it.' I said, 'It
				flows greatly.' He then said, 'You may do one of two
				things: either one will suffice. Which one you are able
				to do you know best. This is a strike from Satan. Be on
				your period for six or seven days, which Allah knows, and
				then perform ghusl until you see that you are clean. Pray
				for fourteen nights or thirteen nights and days and fast,
				and that will be sufficient for you. Do that every month
				as the other women become pure and menstruate. If you
				can, you may delay the noon prayer and hasten the
				afternoon prayer. Perform gh usl and pray the noon and
				afternoon prayers together. Then delay the sunset and
				hasten the night prayers and pray them together. Perform
				ghusl for the morning prayer and pray it. This is how you
				may pray and fast if you have the ability to do so..."
				And he said, "That is the more loved way to me."
			</p>
			<p>
				As to the authenticity of the hadith, it is related by
				Ahmad, Abu Dawud and at-Tirmidhi, who grades it as hassan
				sahih. He says, "I asked al-Bukhari about it, and he
				called it hassan." Ahmad ibn Hanbal says it is hassan
				sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Khattabi observes, in a note to this hadith, that this
				is for the woman who is a "beginner" and does not know
				her regular days of menstruation. The Prophet told her to
				act according to the customary situation of women, and to
				consider herself as having her period only once a month,
				like most women. His statement, 'As women menstruate and
				as they become pure' points to this fact. This is by
				analogy to the affairs of women with respect to each
				other in menstruation, pregnancy, maturity and other
				affairs of theirs."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the third case, a woman has a regular period, but she
				is able to distinguish the blood. She should, therefore,
				behave according to the type of blood she sees. Fatimah
				bint Abu Hubaish had a prolonged flow of blood, and the
				Prophet told her, "If it is menstrual blood, it is dark
				and recognizable. If you have that, abstain from the
				prayer. If it is other than that, make ablution and pray,
				for it is a vein."

			<p>
				The prayer is a type of worship consisting of specific
				statements and actions. It is begun by pronouncing the
				greatness of Allah, and is concluded with salutations of
				peace. As prayer is the essence of Islam, we will discuss
				it here in detail.
			</p>
			<p>
				To state it simply, prayer must exist, for without it
				Islam can not stand. The Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				said, "The head of the matter is Islam, its pillar is the
				prayer, and the top of its hump is jihad in the way of
				Allah." It was the first act of worship that was made
				obligatory by Allah. Its obligation was revealed directly
				to the Prophet, during his ascension to heaven. Said
				Anas, "The prayers were made obligatory on the Prophet,
				upon whom be peace, the night of his ascension to heaven.
				At first, they were fifty in number, but were reduced
				several times until they were five. Then it was
				proclaimed, 'O Muhammad, the order is not changed. These
				five are (equivalent) to the fifty.''
			</p>
			<p>
				As to the authenticity of the report, it is related by
				Ahmad, an-Nasa'i and at-Tirmidhi, who said it is sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				Salah is the first act that the person will be held
				accountable for. 'Abdullah ibn Qart related that the
				Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, said "The first
				act that the slave will be accountable for on the Day of
				Judgement will be prayer. If it is good, then the rest of
				his acts will be good. And if it is evil, then the rest
				of his acts will be evil." (Related by at-Tabarani.) It
				is the last thing that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				recommended to his nation before he died, saying,
				"Prayer, prayer and what your right hand possesses." It
				will be the last thing taken away from the religion. When
				it perishes, Islam will perish. The Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, said, "If Islam were stripped away,
				piece by piece, people would hold tight to the next one.
				The first thing taken would be ruling and governance, and
				the last thing would be prayer." (Related by Ibn Hibban
				from the hadith of Abu Umamah.) In many verses of the
				Qur'an, Allah follows up prayer with the remembrance of
				Allah. "Lo! Worship preserves (one) from lewdness and
				iniquity, but verily, remembrance of Allah is more
				important." (al-'Ankabut 45); "He is successful who grows
				and remembers the name of his Lord, so pray (al-A'la
				14-15); "So serve Me and establish worship for My
				remembrance" (Taha 74). Sometimes He mentions prayer
				along with zakah: "Establish prayer and pay zakah"
				(al-Baqarah 110). And at times, with patience: "Seek help
				in patience and prayer" (al-Baqarah 45), and with hajj:
				"So pray unto your Lord and sacrifice" (al-Kauthar 2);
				"Say: Lo! my worship and my sacrifice and my living and
				my dying are for Allah, Lord of the Worlds. He has no
				partner. This am I commanded, and I am the first of those
				who surrender (unto Him)" (al-An'am 162-163). At other
				times, Allah begins the acts of piety with prayers and
				ends with them, as in the verses about the ma'arij
				(ascension to heaven): "Successful indeed are the
				believers who are humble in their prayers," and the
				verses, "And who pay heed to their prayers. These are the
				heirs who will inherit Paradise. There will they abide"
				(al-Mu'minun 1-29-11).
			</p>
			<p>
				The importance of salah is so great that one is ordered
				to observe it while travelling or not, while one is safe
				or in fear: "Be guardians of your prayers, and of the
				mid-most prayer, and stand up with devotion to Allah. And
				if you go in fear, then (pray) standing or on horseback.
				When you are safe, remember Allah, as He has taught you
				that which (heretofore) you knew not" (al-Baqarah
				238-239).

			<p>
				Not praying and denying its obligation is seen as
				disbelief and places the person outside the religion of
				Islam. All scholars agree on this piont. They base their
				opinion on several hadith, some of which are:
			</p>
			<p>
				Jabir reports that the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said,
				"Between a person and disbelief is discarding prayer."
				(Related by Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi and Ibn
				Majah.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Buraidah reported that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				said, "The pact between us and them is prayer. Whoever
				abandons it is a disbeliever." (Related by Ahmad, Abu
				Dawud, at-Tirmidhi, anNasa'i and Ibn Majah.)
			</p>
			<p>
				'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'Aas reported that the Prophet,
				upon whom be peace, one day mentioned the prayer and
				said, "Whoever guards and observes his prayer, they will
				be a light and a proof and a savior for him on the Day of
				Resurrection. Whoever does not guard and obvserve them,
				they will not be a light or a proof or a savior for him.
				On the Day of Resurrection, he will be with Qarun,
				Fir'aun, Haman and Ubayy ibn Khalf." (Related by Ahmad,
				at-Tabarani and Ibn Hibban. Its chain is excellent.)
			</p>
			<p>
				That one who does not pray will be with the leaders of
				the unbelievers in the Hereafter makes it evident that
				such a person is an unbeliever. Says Ibn al-Qayyim, "The
				one who does not pray may be preoccupied with his wealth,
				kingdom, position or business. If one is kept away from
				his prayers by his wealth, he will be with Qarun. One
				whose kingdom keeps him away from the prayers will be
				with Haman, and one whose business keeps him away from
				the prayers will be with Ubayy ibn Khalf."
			</p>
			<p>
				Says 'Abdullah ibn Shaqiq al-'Aqeely, "The companions of
				Muhammad, peace be upon him, did not consider the
				abandonment of any act, with the exception of prayer, as
				being disbelief." (Related by at-Tirmidhi and al-Hakim,
				who said it met al-Bukahri's and Muslim's conditions.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Says Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Mirwazi, "I heard Ishaq say,
				'It is authentic (that) the Prophet (said or ruled): One
				who does not pray is an unbeliever." It is from the
				Prophet himself that one who intentionally does not pray
				until the time for the prayer is over is an unbeliever."
			</p>
			<p>
				Says Ibn Hazm, "It has come from 'Umar, 'Abdurahman ibn
				'Auf, Mu'adh ibn Jabal, Abu Hurairah and other companions
				that anyone who skips one obligatory prayer until its
				time has finished becomes an apostate. We find no
				difference of opinion among them on this point." This was
				mentioned by al-Mundhiri in at-Targheeb wa atTarheeb.
				Then he comments, "A group of companions and those who
				came after them believed that an intentional decision to
				skip one prayer until its time is completely finished
				makes one an unbeliever. The people of this opinion
				incude 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud,
				'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas, Mu'adh ibn Jabal, Jabir ibn
				'Abdullah and Abu ad-Darda'. Among the non-companions who
				shared this view were Ibn Hanbal, Ishaq ibn Rahwaih,
				'Abdullah ibn al-Mubarak, an-Nakha'i, al-Hakim ibn
				'Utaibah, Abu Ayyub as-Sakhtiyani, Abu Dawud at-Tayalisi,
				Abu Bakr ibn Abu Shaibah, Zuhair ibn Harb, and others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some hadith make it clear that such a person should be
				killed. For example:
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				said, "The ties of Islam and the principles of the
				religion are three, and whoever leaves one of them
				becomes an unbeliever, and his blood becomes lawful:
				testifying that there is no god except Allah, the
				obligatory prayers, and the fast of Ramadan." (Related by
				Abu Ya'la with a hassan chain.) Another narration states,
				"If anyone leaves one of them, by Allah he becomes an
				unbeliever and no voluntary deeds or recompense will be
				accepted from him, and his blood and wealth become
				lawful." This is a clear indication that such a person is
				to be killed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar related that the Messenger of Allah, upon whom
				be peace, said, "I have been ordered to kill the people
				until they testify that there is no god except Allah, and
				that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and they
				establish prayer and pay the zakah. If they do that,
				their blood and wealth are protected from me save by the
				rights of Islam. Their reckoning will be with Allah."
				(Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Umm Salamah related that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				said, "There will be rulers over you who will do good and
				evil things. Whoever hates these (latter) acts will be
				innocent of them. Whoever denies them will be safe, but
				(not) one who accepts and follows them." They asked,
				"Should we kill them?" He said, "Not if they pray."
				(Related by Muslim.) Therefore, he made it unlawful to
				kill even an unjust ruler who observes his prayers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Sa'eed reported that 'Ali, while he was in Yemen,
				sent the Prophet some gold, which he then divided among
				four people. A man said, "O Messenger of Allah, beware of
				Allah." The Prophet said, "Woe to you. Of all the people
				of the earth, am I not the most dutiful in being aware of
				Allah?" Khalid ibn al-Walid said, "O Messenger of Allah,
				shall I kill him?" He said, "Perhaps he is one of those
				who pray." Khalid said, "How many people say with their
				tongues what is not in their hearts?" The Prophet said,
				"I have not been ordered to look into the hearts of
				people, nor to rip open their bellies." (Abridged from
				al-Bukhari and Muslim.) In this hadith also, prayer is
				given as the reason for not killing a person. It is
				understood, therefore, that not praying would have
				resulted in the person's killing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even though the preceding hadith clearly rule that one
				who discards salah becomes an unbeliever and should be
				killed, many early and later scholars (excluding Abu
				Hanifah, Malik and ash-Shafi) believe that such people
				become evildoers who must repent. If such a person does
				not repent, he is to be killed, that being the prescribed
				punishment, according to Malik, ash-Shai'i and others.
				Abu Hanifah maintains that such a person is not to be
				killed, but must be given a minor punishment and confined
				until he prays. They say the hadith that calls such
				people unbelievers refer to those who deny the prayers,
				and so on. They say that any other interpretation is
				contradicted by other texts. For example, Allah says,
				"Lo! Allah does not pardon one who gives Him partners. He
				pardons all save whom He wills" (an-Nisa' 116). There is
				also a hadith related by Abu Hurairah and recorded by
				Ahmad and Muslim in which the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, said, "Every prophet has a special supplication
				that is answered. Every prophet hastened to make his
				supplication, but I concealed mine and will use it for my
				nation on the Day of Resurrection. It will be
				granted--Allah willing--to whoever dies without
				associating any partners with Allah." Al-Bukhari also
				recorded that Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet,
				upon whom be peace, said, "The person who will be the
				happiest due to my intercession is the one who says,
				'There is no god but Allah' sincerely from his heart."
			</p>
			<p>
				Says ash-Shaukani, "The truth of the matter is that he
				becomes an unbeliever who is to be killed for his
				unbelief. The hadith authenticates that Islamic law calls
				one who does not pray an unbeliever. It has also put the
				performance as the barrier between a believer and an
				unbeliever. Abandoning prayer means he may be called an
				unbeliever. We need not concern ourselves with arguments
				presented by those of the opposing opinion. We can say to
				them: It is not impossible that some types of unbelievers
				may obtain forgiveness or may have a right to
				intercession, such as the unbelief of those who pray to (
				our) qiblah. Nevertheless, the fact remains that they
				commit some sins which the Islamic law views as unbelief.
				To turn to the other narrow interpretations is just
				redundant."

				Allah says, "Pray at the two ends of the day and in some
				watches of the night. Lo! Good deeds annul evil deeds.
				This is a reminder for the mindful" (Hud 114). Surah
				al-Isra' states, "Establish prayer at the setting of the
				sun until the dark of the night, and (the recital) of the
				Qur'an at dawn. Lo! The recital of the Qur'an at dawn is
				ever witnessed" (al-Isra' 78), and "Celebrate the praises
				of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its
				setting. Glorify Him some hours of the night and at the
				two ends of the day, that you may find acceptance" (Taha
				130). This verse specifically refers to the dawn prayer
				and the afternoon prayer, as it is recorded in the two
				Sahihs. Jarir ibn 'Abdullah al-Bajali reported, We were
				sitting with the Messenger of Allah and we looked at the
				moon on a clear night. The Prophet said, 'You will see
				your Lord as you see this moon, and you will not be
				harmed by seeing Him. So, if you can, do not let
				yourselves be overpowered in the case of prayer before
				the rising of the sun and its setting,' and he recited
				the above verse."

				Those are the times of the prayers that the Qur'an

			<p>
				'Abdullah ibn 'Amr reported that the Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, said, "The time of the noon prayer is
				when the sun passes the meridian and a man's shadow is
				the same length as his height. It lasts until the time of
				the afternoon prayer. The time of the afternoon prayer is
				until the yellowing of the sun (during its setting). The
				time of the evening prayer is as long as twilight. The
				time of the night prayer is to the middle of a night of
				medium duration. And the time of the morning prayer is
				from the appearance of the dawn until the time of
				sunrise. When the sun rises, abstain from praying, as it
				rises between the horns of Satan." (Related by Muslim. )
			</p>
			<p>
				Jarir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that the angel Gabriel came
				to the Messenger of Allah and said to him, "Stand and
				pray," and they prayed the noon prayer when the sun had
				passed its meridian. He then came to him for the
				afternoon prayer and said,"Stand and pray," and they
				prayed the afternoon prayer while the length of a shadow
				of something was similar to the length of the object.
				Then he came a t sunset and said, "Stand and pray," and
				they prayed the sunset prayer when the sun had just
				disappeared. Then he came at night and said, "Stand and
				pray,"and they prayed the night prayer when the twilight
				had disappeared. He cameagain when dawn broke (and they
				prayed the morning prayer). Then Gabriel came on the next
				day at noon and said (to the Messenger of Allah), "Stand
				and pray," and they prayed the noon prayer when the
				length of the shadow of something was close to the length
				of the object. Then he came for the afternoon prayer and
				said, "Stand and pray," and they prayed when the shadow
				of something was twice as long as the length of the
				object. Then he came at the same time (as the previous
				day) for the sunset prayer, without any change. Then he
				came for the night prayer after half of the night had
				passed ("or," he said, "one-third of the night"). Then he
				came when the sky was very yellow and said, "Stand and
				pray," and they prayed the morning prayer. Then Gabriel
				said, "Between these times are the times for the
				prayers."

			<p>
				The previous two hadith make it clear that the noon
				prayer begins when the sun passes its meridian and it
				continues until an object's shadow is approximately the
				same length as the object itself. If it is extremely hot,
				it is preferred to delay the noon prayer until it is
				cooler. This is done in order to retain the humility and
				awe of the prayer. If this is not the case, it should be
				prayed early in its time. This opinion is based on the
				following hadith: Reported Anas, "If it was extremely
				cold, the Prophet, upon whom be peace, would pray early.
				If it was extremely hot, he would wait for it to cool
				down." (Related by al-Bukhari.) Abu Dharr relates, "We
				were with the Prophet, upon whom be peace, on a journey.
				When the caller to prayer wanted to give the adhan, the
				Prophet said 'Let it cool down.' This happened two or
				three times, until we saw the shadows of the hills. Then
				the Prophet said, 'The extreme heat is from the fragrance
				of Hell. If the heat becomes extreme, delay the prayer
				until it becomes cool." (Related by al-Bukhari and
				Muslim.) However, this delay does have a limit. According
				to Ibn Hajr's Fath al-Bari, "The scholars differ over how
				long one may wait to let the temperature cool. Some say,
				'Until the shadow of an object becomes an arm's length,'
				or 'Until the shadow becomes one-fourth of one's height.'
				Others say one-third or one-half, and so on. Its ruling
				is according to its basic principle, and it changes with
				different circumstances, provided that the prayer is not
				delayed until the end of its time."

				This prayer begins in the afternoon when the shadow of an
				object is of the same length as the object itself, and
				continues until the sun sets. Abu Hurairah reported that
				the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, "Whoever catches
				one rak'ah of the afternoon prayer before the sun sets
				and then prays the remainder of the prayer after the sun
				has set has not missed the afternoon prayer."
			</p>
			<p>
				The best and most preferred time to pray the afternoon
				prayer ends when the sun becomes yellowish on the
				horizon. This is implied by the preceding hadith of Jabir
				and 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar. To delay the prayer until the
				sun becomes yellowish, although it is permissiable, is
				greatly disliked, unless there is some need to do so.
				Anas reported that he heard the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, say, "The following is the prayer of the
				hypocrite: he waits until the sun is between the horns of

				he does not remember Allah therein save a little bit."

				Says an-Nawawi in his commentary on Sahih Muslim, "Our
				companions (the Shafiyyah) hold that the afternoon prayer
				time can be divided into five categories: the most
				virtuous time, the preferred time, the allowable time in
				which there is no disliked aspect, the allowable time
				that contains some aspect of dislike, and the time that
				is due to some excuse or necessity. The most virtuous
				time is at the beginning of the permissible time. The
				preferred time is until the shadow of an object is twice
				the length of the object itself. The permissible time
				without any aspect of dislike is from the time the sun
				becomes yellowish. The permissible time with some aspect
				of dislike is from the time the sun becomes yellowish
				until the setting of the sun. The time of excuse or
				necessity begins, in fact, at the time of the noon prayer
				for one who is to combine the noon and afternoon prayers,
				due to travelling or rain. If the afternoon prayer is
				made during any of those times, it has been fulfilled
				properly. If all of those times pass and the sun has set,
				then one must make up the prayer."

				On a cloudy day, it should be prayed earlier in its time.
				Buraidah al-Aslami reported, "We were with the Messenger

				also makes an exception for voluntary prayers on Friday
				while the sun is at its meridian. The Shariyyah say that
				voluntary prayers which are not offered for a particular

				voluntary prayers because of some occasion, voluntary
				prayers on Friday when the sun is at its meridian and the
				prayer of the circumambulation of the Ka'bah are all

				Yasar, the client of Ibn 'Umar, said, "Ibn 'Umar saw me

				said, 'The Messenger of Allah came to us while we were

				We can conclude from this that it is disiked to make
				voluntary prayers beyond the two sunnah rak'ah after the
				dawn has begun. This was stated by ash-Shaukani.
				Al-Hassan, ash-Shaifi, and Ibn Hazm say voluntary prayers
				are permissible at that time without any aspect of
				dislike. Malik openly allowed prayers during that time
				for those who missed the voluntary prayers during the
				night due to some excuse. It is mentioned that it reached
				him that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas, al-Qasim ibn Muhammad, and
				'Abdullah ibn 'Aamar ibn Rabi'ah would pray the witr
				prayer after the dawn had begun. Said 'Abdullah ibn
				Mas'ud, "It does not bother me if they make the iqamah
				(the second call) to prayer while I am praying witr."
				Yahya ibn Sa'eed reported, " 'Ibadah ibn as-Samit was the
				imam for the people. One day he went to the morning
				prayer and the caller to prayer made the iqamah for the
				prayer. 'Ibadah kept quiet until he prayed the witr
				prayer and then he led them in the morning prayer."
				Sa'eed ibn Jubair reported that Ibn 'Abbas slept (one
				night), woke up and told his servant, "Look to see what
				the people are doing." (By that time he had lost his
				eyesight). The servant returned and told him that they
				were dispersing from the morning prayer. Ibn 'Abbas then
				stood, prayed witr and prayed the morning prayer.

				It is preferred that whoever is listening to the adhan
				repeat it with the caller, except for the two hayya

			</p>
			<p>
				Says an-Nawawi, "Our companions hold that it is
				preferable for the listener to repeat after the caller
				(to prayer), except when he comes to the two preceding
				phrases, for this shows that he approves of what the
				caller is saying. Those two statements are calls to the
				prayer, and it is only proper for the caller to prayer to
				say them. It is preferable for the listener to say
				something, such as La haula wa la quwatah illa billah. It
				is confirmed in the two Sahihs from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari
				that the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, 'La haula wa
				la quwatah illa billah is a treasure from the treasures
				of Paradise.' Our companions say that to repeat the call
				to prayer is preferred for everyone who hears the call,
				whether clean or unclean, in a state of post-sexual
				uncleanliness or menstruating, and so on, as it is a
				remembrance and all of those people who can should make
				it. Those who can not do so are the ones who are praying,
				who are relieving themselves, or are having sexual
				intercourse. If one is reciting the Qur'an, or making
				remembrance of Allah (dhikr) or studying and so on, he
				should stop what he is doing and repeat after the caller
				to prayer. He may then return to what he was doing, if he
				wishes, or he can pray a voluntary or obligatory prayer."
				Says ash-Shaf'i, "One should not repeat after the call to
				prayer, but when he finishes he should repeat what he has
				said." In al-Mughni, it says, "If one enters the mosque
				and hears the adhan, it is best that he wait until the
				caller finishes it before he begins to repeat it. This
				way he will catch both good deeds. If he does not repeat
				after the call but starts praying, there is no problem.
				This is what Ahmad says on the subject."

			<p>
				The Muslim should pray for the Prophet, peace be upon
				him, after the call is over in any of the manners that
				have been related, and ask Allah to give him the place of
				wasilah. 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr related that the Messenger of
				Allah, upon whom be peace, said, "If you hear the call to
				prayer, repeat after it. Then supplicate for me, for
				whoever makes one supplication for me, Allah makes ten
				for him. Then ask Allah to grant me the place of wasilah.
				It is a place in Paradise reserved for a slave from among
				the slaves of Allah. I hope to be him, and whoever asks
				Allah to grant me the place of wasilah, my intercession
				becomes permissible for him." (Related by Muslim.) Jabir
				reported that the Prophet said, "Whoever says (after)
				hearing the call to prayer, 'O Allah, Lord of this

				Muhammad the place of wasilah, the most virtuous place

				The adhan is to be made exactly at the beginning of the
				prayer time, except for the morning prayer, when it may
				be said before dawn (provided that the people are able to
				distinguish between the early adhan and that of the
				proper time). 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar related that the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, "Bilal makes the adhan
				during the night, so eat and drink until you hear the
				adhan of Ibn Umm Maktum." (Related by al-Bukhari and
				Muslim.) The wisdom behind allowing the morning adhan a
				little earlier is made clear in a hadith recorded by
				Ahmad and others from Ibn Mas'ud: "None of you should let
				Bilal's adhan prevent you from the pre-dawn meal, as he
				is making the adhan for those who are praying to stop and
				for those who are sleeping to get up." But Bilal made his
				adhan in exactly the same way as the regular adhan.
				At-Tahawi and an-Nasa'i relate that the time difference
				between Bilal's adhan and that of Ibn Umm Maktum was the
				time it took for one to come down from the minaret and
				for the others to get up to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enough time should be left between the adhan and iqamah
				for people to prepare themselves for prayer and get to
				the mosque. The hadith that state the time difference are
				weak. Al-Bukhari has a section entitled How Much Time Is
				There Between the Adhan and Iqamah?, but no specific
				length of time has been confirmed therein. Ibn Batal
				said, "There is no time limit set, except that of the
				time beginning and the people gathering for the prayer."
				Jabir ibn Sumra said, "The callers to prayer of the
				Prophet would make the adhan and then leave some time,
				making the iqamah only when they saw the Prophet, upon

				The caller saying, "I bear witness that our leader

				Muhammad is the messenger of Allah,' and with the
				listener saying, 'I bear witness that Muhammad is His
				slave and messenger. I am pleased with Allah as Lord,
				with Islam as religion, and with Muhammad as the
				Prophet," is based on ad-Dailami's report from Abu Bakr
				that when he heard the caller say, "I bear witness that
				Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah," he would say the
				same, kiss the inside of his index fingers and wipe his
				eyes. The Prophet then said, "Whoever does what my friend
				(Abu Bakr) did, then my intercession will be permissible

			<p>
				Such objects should be clean of physical impurities as
				much as possible. If one can not remove them, he may pray
				with the impurities present and does not have to repeat
				the prayer later. Concerning bodily purity, Anas related
				that the Prophet upon whom be peace, said, "Stay clean of
				urine, as the majority of punishment in the grave is due
				to it." This is related by ad-Daraqutni, who said it is
				hassan.

				Reported 'Ali, I used to have a great deal of prostatic
				fluid flowing, so I asked a man to ask the Prophet about
				it (as I was shy to ask him, due to my relationship with

				'Aishah also related that the Messenger of Allah said to

				from yourself and pray . "
			</p>
			<p>
				Concerning purity of clothing, we have the following:
				Says Allah, "And purify your raiment" (al-Muddathir 4).
				Jabir ibn Sumrah reported that he heard a man ask the
				Prophet, "May I pray in the same clothes that I had on
				during intercourse with my wife?" He said, "Yes, but if
				you see some stains on it, you must wash it." This hadith
				is related by Ahmad and Ibn Majah. Its narrators are
				trustworthy. Reported Mu'awiyyah, "I asked Umm Habibah,
				'Did the Prophet pray in the same clothes that he wore
				when he had intercourse?' She said, 'Yes, if there were
				no stains on it."'(Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, an-Nasa'i
				and Ibn Majah.) Abu Sa'eed reported that the Prophet
				removed his shoes and the people behind him did likewise.
				When he finished the prayer, he asked, "Why did you
				remove your shoes?" They said, "We saw you remove yours."
				He said, "Gabriel came to me and informed me that there
				was some filth on them. Therefore, when one of you comes
				to the mosque, he should turn his shoes over and examine
				them. If one finds any dirt on them, he should rub them
				against the ground and pray with them on." The hadith is
				related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Hakim, Ibn Hibban and Ibn
				Khuzaimah. The latter grades it as sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				This hadith shows that if one enters the mosque (with his
				shoes on) and is unaware of some impurity or has
				forgotten it, and he suddenly remembers it during the
				prayer, he must try to remove it and proceed with the
				prayer. He does not have to repeat it later on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Concerning the purity of the place where one is praying,
				Abu Hurairah said, "A bedouin stood and urinated in the
				mosque. The people got up to grab him. The Prophet said,
				'Leave him and pour a container full of water over his
				urine. You have been raised to be easy on the people, not
				to be hard on them." (Related by "the group," except for
				Muslim.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on this subject, ash-Shaukani says, "If what
				has been produced of proof is firmly established, then
				one would know that it is obligatory to have one's
				clothes free of impurities. Whoever prays and has
				impurities on his clothing has left one of the
				obligations of the prayer. But his prayer would not be
				voided." In ar-Raudhat an-Nabiyyah it states, "The
				majority of scholars are of the opinion that it is
				obligatory to purify three things: the body, the clothes,
				and the place of prayer. Some are of the opinion that
				this is a condition for the soundness of the prayer, and
				others say that it is just a sunnah. The truth of the
				matter is that it is obligatory. Whoever intentionally
				prays with impurities on his clothing has left one of the
				obligations (of the prayer), but the prayer is still
				valid."

			Says Ibn Hazm, "It is correct to say that the thigh is not part
			of the 'aurah. If it were so, why would Allah allow His Prophet,
			who is protected (from sin), to uncover his so that Anas and
			others could see it? Allah would have kept him from doing this.
			According to Jabir as recorded in the two Sahihs, when the
			Prophet was young (before his prophethood), he was one time
			carrying the stones of the Ka'bah, wearing only a loincloth. His
			uncle al-'Abbas said to him, 'O nephew, why don't you untie your

			did so and fell unconscious. He was never seen naked again after
			that."'

			Hazm said, "If the thigh was 'aurah, why would the Messenger of

			why would he have struck it with his hand? The same can be asked
			for 'Abdullah ibn as-Samit and Abu al-'Aliya. It is not allowed
			for a Muslim to strike with his hand another man's pubic area, or
			the clothes over the pubic area. Nor can a man touch the clothing

				He should ask one who knows. If he finds no one to ask,
				he should try his best to determine it. In such a case,
				his prayer will be valid, and he need not repeat it even
				though he discovers later on that he had faced in the
				wrong direction. If it is made clear to him while he is
				praying that he is facing the wrong direction, he need
				only turn in the proper direction without stopping his
				prayer. This is based on the following incident: Ibn
				'Umar reported that the people were praying the morning
				prayer in the Quba' mosque when a person came to them and
				said, "Allah has revealed some of the Qur'an to the
				Prophet in which we have been ordered to face the Ka'bah,
				so face it." They immedately turned their faces from
				Syria to the Ka'bah." (Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.)
			</p>
			<p>
				If one prays according to what he determined and then
				wants to make another prayer, he should again try to
				determine the qiblah's direction. If it turns out to be
				different from what he had determined earlier, he should
				pray in the new direction without repeating his earlier
				prayer.

		<section heading="Two cases in which one doesn't have to face the Ka'bah">
			<p>
				The first one is performing voluntary prayers while
				riding (an animal, car and so on). The rider may bend his
				head slightly for the bowings and prostrations of the
				prayer, but he should bend a little bit lower for the
				prostrations. He may face in whatever direction his ride
				is going.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reported 'Amr ibn Rabi'ah, "I saw the Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, pray while riding, and he faced the
				direction in which he was going." This hadith is related
				by Muslim, at-Tirmidhi and al-Bukhari. The latter added
				that "he bent his head slighty."
			</p>
			<p>
				He did not, however, do this for the obligatory prayers.
				Ahmad, Muslim and at-Tirmidhi recorded that he would pray
				on his mount while travelling from Makkah to Madinah,
				facing away from Makkah. Upon this, Allah revealed,
				"Wherever you turn, you will find Allah's face." Says
				Ibrahim an-Nakha'i, "They would pray on their mounts and
				animals in the direction in which they were facing." Ibn
				Hazm comments, "This has been related from the companions
				and those of the following generation, during travel and
				residence. "
			</p>
			<p>
				The second case is praying while having to deal with
				forced conditions, illness and fear. Under such
				circumstances, it is allowed to pray without facing the
				qiblah. The Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, "If I
				order you to do something, do what you are capable of
				doing." Says Allah, "If you go in fear, then (pray)
				standing or on your mounts..." (al-Baqarah 239). Ibn
				'Umar added, "Facing the qiblah or not facing it."

				There are many prophetic hadith on this topic. Here, we
				will mention just two of them, one describing his actions
				and other quoting his statements.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Abdullah ibn Ghanam related that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari
				gathered together his people saying, " O Tribe of
				Ash'ari, gather together, and gather your women and
				children to teach them how the Messenger of Allah, upon
				whom be peace, prayed with us in Madinah." They all
				gathered to watch him perform ablution. After it, he
				waited until the sun had just passed the meridian and
				there was some shade, and then he made the adhan. He put
				the men in the row closest to him, the children in a row
				behind the men, and the women in a row behind the
				children. After the iqamah, he raised his hands and made
				the takbir, silently recited Surah al-Fatihah and another
				surah, repeated the takbir and bowed while saying, "Glory
				be to Allah and Praise be to Him" three times, after
				which he said, "Allah hears him who praises Him" and
				stood straight. He then made the takbir and prostrated,
				made another takbir, raised his head (and sat), repeated
				the takbir and prostrated again, after which he said the
				final takbir and stood up. In the first rak'ah he made
				six takbir, and he made another one when he stood for the
				second rak'ah. When he finished the prayer, he turned to
				his people and said, "Guard the number of my takbir and
				learn my bowings and prostrations, for this is how the
				Prophet prayed with us during this part of the day."
				(Then he said) when the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				finished the prayer, he turned toward the people and
				said, "O people, listen and understand. Allah has slaves
				who are neither prophets nor martyrs, but both the
				prophets and martyrs envy them for their closeness to
				Allah." A bedouin stepped forward, pointed to the
				Messenger of Allah and said, "O Messenger of Allah, tell
				us about these people." The Prophet was pleased with the
				bedouin's request and said, "They are from various
				peoples and tribes who have no ties of relationship
				between them. They love each other purely for the sake of
				Allah. On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will present
				them pulpits of light for them to sit on. Their faces
				will be light and their clothes will be light. The people
				will be scared on the Day of Resurrection, but they will
				not be scared. They are the friends of Allah who will not
				have any fear upon them nor will they grieve.
			</p>
			<p>
				As to the authenticity of this report, it is related by
				Ahmad and Abu Ya'la with a hassan chain. Al-Hakim says
				its chain is sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reported Abu Hurairah, "A man entered the mosque and,
				after praying, went to the Prophet, upon whom be peace.
				The Prophet, upon whom be peace, responded to his
				salutations and said, 'Return and pray, for you have not
				prayed.' This happened three times, and the man finally
				said, 'By the One who sent you with the Truth, I do not
				know any better than that, so teach me.' He said, 'When
				you stand for the prayer, make the takbir and then recite
				what you can from the Qur'an. Then bow until you attain
				calmness and then come up again until you are standing
				straight. Then prostrate until you attain calmness in
				your sitting, and prostate until you attain calmness in
				your prostration. Do that during all of your prayer."

				One must stand during the prayer, if at all possible.
				Says Allah, "Guard and preserve the prayers and the
				mid-most prayer, and stand for Allah with devotion."
				Reported 'Umar ibn Hussain, "I had some physical problem,
				so I asked the Prophet, upon whom be peace, about the
				prayer, and he said, 'Pray standing; if you are not able
				to; pray sitting, if you are not able to; pray (while

				For voluntary prayers, one can pray sitting even if he

				If one can not stand, he may pray according to what he is

			<p>
				There are many authentic hadith which state that it is

				there is no difference of opinion on this point. Some of
				these hadith are:
			</p>
			<p>
				'Ibadah ibn as-Samit related that the Prophet said,
				"There is no prayer for one who does not recite the

			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet said, "Whoever
				prays a prayer and does not recite the opening chapter of
				the Qur'an has not prayed correctly." (Related by Ahmad,
				al-Bukhari and Muslim.) Ad-Daraqutni also recorded a
				hadith with a sahih chain with almost exactly the same
				wording.
			</p>
			<p>
				Said Abu Sa'eed, "We were ordered to recite the opening
				chapter of the Qur'an and what (else) was easy (for us)."
				This is related by Abu Dawud. Al-Hafez and Ibn Sayyid
				an-Nass consider its chain as sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				In some of the narrations dealing with the prayer's
				incompleteness, it states, "And then recite the 'Mother
				of the Book' (al-Fatihah)," and he said, "And do that in
				every rak'ah."
			</p>
			<p>
				It is confirmed that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				recited al-Fatihah in every rak'ah of every prayer,
				obligatory or superogatory. Since this is an act of
				worship, we can only follow what he did. And the Prophet
				said, "Pray as you have seen me pray." (Related by

		<section heading="Obligatory acts of prayer, Bismillah">
			<p>
				The scholars are agreed that the bismillah (the words "In
				the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful) is a
				verse in Surah al-Naml, but they differ over whether or
				not it constitutes a verse of every surah. There are
				three opinions on this point:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					It is a verse of al-Fatihah and of every surah of
					the Qur'an. Therefore, it is to be recited with
					al-Fatihah during those prayers that are said
					aloud or quietly. The strongest support of this
					opinion comes from the hadith of Na'em
					al-Mujammir who said, "I prayed behind Abu
					Hurairah and he recited, 'In the name of
					Allah...' and then he recited al-Fatihah." At the
					end of the hadith, he is quoted as saying, "By
					the One in whose Hand is my soul, I have done
					what resembles how we prayed with the Messenger
					of Allah."
				</li>
				<li>
					It is a verse by itself and was revealed to
					demarcate different surahs. It is allowed to
					recite it with al-Fatihah (in fact it is
					preferred), but it is not sunnah to recite it
					aloud. Anas said, "I prayed behind the Messenger
					of Allah, Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman, and they
					did not recite it aloud."
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This hadith is related by an-Nasa'i, Ibn Hibban and
				at-Tahawi with a sahih chain according to the criterion
				of the two Sahihs.

				Says al-Khattabi, "Basically, one's prayer does not

				recite neither al-Fatihah nor other portions of the
				Qur'an, he should recite at least seven verses of a
				similar meaning from the Qur'an. If he can not learn any
				part of the Qur'an (due to some innate inability, poor

				and tahleel (La ilaha illal-lah - There is no God except

				There is a consensus on the obligatory nature of the

				established by bending over, putting one's hands on one's
				knees, and remaining in that position until he attains
				"calmness." In another hadith the Prophet said, "Then bow
				until you attain calmness while your are bowing." Abu
				Qatadah related that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,

		<section heading="Obligatory acts of prayer, The Final Sitting and Recital of the Tashahud">
			<p>
				The Prophet's practice illustrates that when the final
				sitting of the prayer has been made, one must recite the
				tashahud at that time. In one hadith, he said, "When you
				raise your head from the last prostration and sit for the
				tashahud, you have completed your prayer."
			</p>
			<p>
				Says Ibn Qudamah, "It has been related that Ibn 'Abbas
				said, 'We used to say, before the tashahud was made
				obligatory upon us, 'Peace be upon Allah before His
				slaves, peace be upon Gabriel, peace be upon Mikhail.'
				The Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, 'Do not say,
				'Peace be upon Allah,' but say, 'Salutations to Allah.'
				This proves that the tashah ud was made obligatory,
				although before it was not."
			</p>
			<p>
				The most authentic report concerning the tashahud is Ibn
				Mas'ud's, who said, "When we would sit with the Prophet
				in the prayer, we would say, 'Peace be upon Allah before
				His slaves, peace be upon so and so.' The Prophet said,
				'Do not say peace be upon Allah, for Allah is peace. When
				one of you sits, he should say salutations be to Allah,
				and the prayers, and the good deeds, peace be upon us and
				upon Allah's sincere slaves (if you say that, it applies
				to all of Allah's sincere slaves in the heavens and the
				earth). I bear witness that there is no god except Allah.
				I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.'
				Then you may choose whatever supplication you desire."

				Says Muslim, "The people are in agreement over the
				tashahud of Ibn Mas'ud, and the companions do not differ
				over it." At-Tirmidhi, al-Khattabi, Ibn 'Abdul-Barr and
				Ibn al-Mundhir all agree that Ibn Mas'ud's hadith is the
				most authentic one on this topic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Said Ibn 'Abbas, "The Messenger of Allah used to teach us
				the tashahud like he taught us the Qur'an. He would say,
				'Salutations, blessings, prayers and good deeds for
				Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of
				Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us and the sincere
				slaves of Allah. I bear witness that there is no god
				except Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave
				and messenger." (Related by ash-Shaifi, Muslim, Abu Dawud
				and anNasa'i.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Says ash-Shaifi, "Different hadith have been related
				about the tashahud, but that one is the best in my
				opinion, for it is the most complete. Al-Hafez states,
				"Ash-Shaifi was asked about this choice and the tashahud
				of Ibn 'Abbas, and he replied, 'I have found it to be the
				most encompassing. I have heard it from Ibn 'Abbas
				(through) authentic (chains). To me, it is more
				complete..."
			</p>
			<p>
				There is another form of the tashahud that Malik chose.
				In al-Muwatta, it is stated that 'Abdurahman ibn
				'Abdul-Qari heard 'Umar ibn al-Khattab teaching the
				people, from the pulpit, this tashahud: "Salutations to
				Allah, purifications to Allah, the good deeds and prayers
				be to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy

				Commenting on the stature of such hadith, an-Nawawi says,

				left side until I could see the whiteness of his cheeks."
				(Related by Ahmad, Muslim, anNasa'i and Ibn Majah.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Reported Wa'il ibn Hajr, "I prayed with the Messenger of
				Allah. He would make the salaam on his right side by
				saying, 'Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah." In
				Bulugh al-Maram, Ibn Hajr says that Abu Dawud related it
				with a sahih chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is obligatory to say one salaam, and it is preferred
				to say two. Ibn al-Mundhir comments that all scholars
				agree that making only one salaam is permissible. Ibn
				Qudamah writes in al-Mughni, "There is no clear text from
				Ahmad that states that two salaams are obligatory. He
				only said, 'Two salaams are the most authentic act from
				the Messenger of Allah.' It is permissible to say that
				this is the regualtion, although it is not obligatory,
				and others have the same opinion. This is also pointed
				out in another of his statements where he said, 'Two
				salaams are more loved by me. But 'Aishah, Salamah ibn
				al-Aku' and Sahl ibn Sa'd narrated that the Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, made only one salaam." We can reconciliate
				these differences by stating that it is sunnah to say two
				salaams, but it is obligatory to say one. This is the
				consensus that Ibn al-Mundhir mentioned, and we have no
				option to reject that. Says an-Nawawi, "It is the opinion
				of ash-Shaifi and most of the early and later scholars
				that it is sunnah to say two salaams." Malik and a group
				of scholars say that only one salaam is sunnah. They
				adduce this from a weak hadith that can not be used as a
				proof. If something of this nature had been confirmed
				from the Prophet, the act was probably done just to show
				that it is permissible to say only one salaam. Scholars
				are agreed that only one salaam is obligatory. If one
				makes only one salaam, he should turn to his right for
				the first one and to the left for the second one. He
				should turn until his cheeks can be seen from behind.
				That is the most authentic form and it is said, "If one
				says the two salaams to the right or to the left while
				facing forward, or the first one on the left and the
				second one on the right, then his prayer would still be
				valid and he would have fulfilled the act of the two
				salaams. But, he would have lost the virtue of how they
				are to be performed."

			<p>
				One must raise the hands at about the same time he makes
				the takbir. Nafa' related that when Ibn 'Umar would begin
				his prayer he would say the takbir and raise his hands.
				The Prophet also did this. (Related by al-Bukhari,
				an-Nasa'i and Abu Dawud.) He also reported that the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, would raise his hands upon
				making the takbir until they were parallel to his
				shoulders or close to that. (Related by Ahmad and
				others.)
			</p>
			<p>
				As for raising the hands just before the takbir, Ibn
				'Umar reported, "When the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				stood for prayer, he would raise his hands until they
				were parallel to his shoulders and would make the takbir.
				(Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.) A hadith from Malik
				ibn al-Huwairith has the wording, "Make the takbir and
				then raise your hands." (Related by Muslim.) This implies
				that the takbir comes before the raising of the hands,
				but Ibn Hajr says, "I have not met anyone who holds that
				the takbir comes before the raising of the hands."
			</p>
			<p>
				It is preferred to raise one's hands while going to bow
				and upon coming up from the bow
			</p>
			<p>
				Twenty-two companions narrated that the Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, did so. Reported Ibn 'Umar, "When the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, stood to pray, he would
				raise his hands until they were the same height as his
				shoulders and then he would make the takbir. When he
				wanted to bow, he would again raise his hands in a
				similar fashion. When he raised his head from the bowing,
				he did the same and said, 'Allah hears him who praises
				Him.' (Related by al-Bukhari, Muslim and al-Baihaqi.)
				Says al-Bukhari, "He would not do that when he was going
				to prostrate nor when he came up from his prostration."
				Al-Bukhari also says, "He would not raise his hands
				between the two prostrations." Al-Baihaqi has the
				addition, "He did not stop doing that until he met
				Allah." Ibn al-Madini said, "In my opinion, that hadith
				is a proof for the whole creation. Whoever hears it must
				act by it. There is nothing wrong with its chain."
				Al-Bukhari wrote a pamphlet on this topic, and related
				from al-Hassan and Humaid ibn Hilal that the companions
				used to (perform their prayers) in this manner.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the contrary, the Hanafiyyah say that one should only
				raise his hands at the beginning. This is based on the
				hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, who reported, "I prayed with the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, and he raised his hands only
				once." This is a weak opinion, and many hadith scholars
				have criticized this report. Ibn Hibban, though, said
				that this is the best report.
			</p>
			<p>
				The people of Kufah narrated that the Prophet, upon whom
				be peace, did not raise his hands upon bowing or rising.
				But, in fact, this is a very weak statement, for it
				contains many defects and is therefore invalid. Even if
				we accept it, as at-Tirmidhi did, it does not invalidate
				the authentic and well-known hadith mentioned earlier.
				The author of at-Tanqih says that perhaps Ibn Mas'ud
				forgot that the Prophet, upon whom be peace, raised his
				hands. Az-Zaila'i writes in Nasb ar-Rayah, quoting the
				author of at-Tanqih, "It is not strange that Ibn Mas'ud
				may have forgotten that. Ibn Mas'ud forgot some things
				from the Qur'an that the Muslims after him never differed
				about, and those are the last two surahs of the Qur'an.
				He forgot how two people are to stand behind the imam,
				that the Prophet prayed the morning prayer on the Day of
				Sacrifice (during the hajj) at its proper time, how the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, combined his prayers at
				'Arafah, the position of the forearms and elbows during
				the prostration, and how the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				recited, 'And Him who created the male and the female.'
				If it is possible that Ibn Mas'ud forgot all of these
				things concerning the prayer, is it not possible that he
				also forgot about raising the hands?"
			</p>
			<p>
				Nafa' related that when Ibn 'Umar stood for the third
				rak'ah, he would raise his hands, an action which he
				ascribed to the Prophet. (Related by al-Bukhari, Abu
				Dawud and an-Nasa'i.) While describing the Prophet's
				prayer, 'Ali said that when he stood from the two
				prostrations, he would raise his hands until they reached
				his shoulders and make the takbir.
			</p>
			<p>
				Women have to do this the same way. Says Ash-Shaukani,
				"Know that this sunnah is to be done by men and women.
				There is no proof to show that there is any difference
				between them on this point. There is also no proof to
				show that they are to raise their hands to different
				levels."

		<section heading="Sunnah acts of prayer, The Opening Supplication">

				It is preferred for the person to begin his prayer with
				one of the supplications that the Prophet, upon whom be

				opening takbir and before the recitation of al-Fatihah.
				Some of the supplications that have been related are:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Reported Abu Hurairah, "When the Prophet, upon
					whom be peace, made the opening takbir, he would
					be quiet for a little while before his
					recitation. I asked him, 'O Messenger of Allah,
					may my father and mother be sacrificed for you,
					why are you quiet between the (opening) takbir
					and your recitation? What do you say (at that
					time)?' He said, 'I say, O Allah, make the
					distance between me and my sins as far as you
					have made the distance between the East and the
					West. O Allah, cleanse me of my sins as a white
					garment is cleansed of dirt. O Allah, purify me
					from my sins by snow, rain and hail." (Related by
					al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, an-Nasa'i and Ibn
					Majah.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Reported 'Ali, that when the Prophet stood for
					prayer, he would make the takbir and then say, "I
					have turned my face to the one who created the
					heavens and the earth as a sincere submissive
					(person), and I am not one of the polytheists. My
					prayers, my sacrifice, my life and my death are
					all for Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. He has no
					partner. That is what I have been ordered and I
					am of those who submit. O Allah, you are the King
					and there is no Lord besides You. You are my Lord
					and I am Your slave. I have wronged my soul and
					You are aware of my sins, so forgive all of my
					sins. No one forgives sins save You. Guide me to
					the best character. No one can guide to the best
					of that save You. Turn me away from its evil, and
					no one can turn me from its evil save You. At
					your beck and call, all the good is in Your hands
					and evil is not to You. And I am for You and to
					You are the blessings and the exaltedness. I seek
					your forgiveness and return unto You." (Related
					by Ahmad, Muslim, at-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and
					others.)
				</li>
				<li>
					It is related that 'Umar used to say, after the
					beginning takbir, "Glory be to You, O Allah, and
					to You is the praise. Blessed is Your name and
					most high is Your honor. There is no Lord besides
					You." This hadith is related by Muslim with a
					broken chain. Ad-Daraqutni traces it back to the
					Prophet and back to 'Umar.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Commenting on it, Ibn al-Qayyim says, "It has been
				authenticated that 'Umar began with that in the place (of
				the preceding prayer) of the Prophet, upon whom be peace.
				He would recite it aloud and teach it to the people. And
				owing to that fact, it is considered to have its source
				with the Prophet, upon whom be peace. For that reason,
				Imam Ahmad says, "I act by what has been related from
				'Umar. If a person begins with something that has been
				related, it is good."
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking of it, Ibn al-Qayyim says, "The jurists differ
				over whether or not that is a time to say, 'I seek
				refuge...' But they agree that it is not a place to make
				the opening supplication. On the former point, there are
				two opinions, both of them related from Ahmad. Some of
				his companions concluded that either the prayer is only
				one recitation, so it is sufficient just to seek refuge
				once, or that each recital is a recital by itself that
				requires the seeking of refuge. They do not dispute the
				fact that the opening supplication is for the whole
				prayer. It is sufficient to seek refuge only once, as it
				is apparent from the authentic hadith." Then he mentions
				the preceding hadith of Abu Hurairah, and says, "It is
				sufficient just to make one opening supplication, since
				there is no real break between the recital of the prayer.
				The only thing that is between them is the remembrance of
				Allah, and so on. Therefore, it will be considered as one
				recital. Ash Shaukani has the final word, and says, 'It
				is best just to do what has been related from the sunnah,
				and that is to seek refuge in the first rak'ah only."

		<section heading="Sunnah acts of prayer, Saying 'Ameen">
			<p>
				It is sunnah for everyone to say 'ameen after reciting
				al-Fatihah. The word ameen is not part of al-Fatihah, but
				rather a supplication meaning, "O Allah, respond (to or
				answer what we have said). It should be said aloud in the
				prayers where the recital is aloud, and quietly in the
				prayers where the recital is silent. Said Na'eem
				al-Mujamir, "I prayed behind Abu Hurairah and he said,
				'In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful,'
				then recited al-Fatihah, and closed it with 'ameen. The
				people also said 'ameen. After the prayer, Abu Hurairah
				said, 'By the One in whose Hand is my soul, I have
				followed the prayer of the Prophet."
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Bukhari mentioned this hadith in mu'allaq from while
				others, such as an-Nasa'i, Ibn Khuzaimah, Ibn Hibban and
				Ibn as-Siraj related it. Al-Bukhari records that Ibn
				Shihab (az-Zuhri) said, "The Messenger of Allah, upon

			</p>
			<p>
				Says 'Ata, "'Ameen is a supplication." Ibn az-Zubair and
				those behind him would say 'ameen and the mosque would
				ring with their voices.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reported Nafa', "Ibn 'Umar did not encourage the people
				to say it aloud, nor did he discourage them. I have heard
				him report that." Reporting on this same subject, Abu
				Hurairah said, "When the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be
				peace, would recite, '...Not with those with whom You are
				displeased and not of those who have gone astray,' he
				would say, 'ameen such that those close to him could hear
				him." (Related by Abu Dawud.) Ibn Majah's version is,
				"Until the people in the first row would hear him, and
				the mosque would ring with the sound." Al-Hakim also
				relates this hadith, and says that it is sahih according
				to the criterion of al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Baihaqi
				calls it hassan sahih. Ad-Daraqutni considers it as
				hassan.
			</p>
			<p>
				A similar report from Wa'il ibn Jubair says, "I heard the
				Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, recite, '...and
				not of those who have gone astray,' and then say 'ameen,
				and make it long with his voice." This was related by
				Ahmad. Abu Dawud has it with the wording, "And he would
				raise his voice with it." At-Tirmidhi classifies it as
				hassan and states, "More than one knowledgeable companion
				and those who followed them have said that a person
				should raise his voice while saying 'ameen and not make
				it silent." Ibn Hajr holds that the chain of this hadith
				is sahih. Reported 'Ata, "I have found two hundred
				companions of the Prophet, upon whom be peace, in this
				mosque and when the imam recited,'...and not of those who
				have gone astray,' I heard them say 'ameen."'Aishah
				reported that the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said, 'The
				Jews do not envy you for anything more than they envy you
				for the salutations and the saying of 'ameen behind the
				imam." (Related by Ahmad and Ibn Majah)
			</p>
			<p>
				It is preferred to say 'ameen along with the imam, and
				not before or after him
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, said, When the imam recites, '... not of those
				with whom You are angered nor of those who have gone
				astray,' you should say 'ameen. If this corresponds to
				when the angels say it, he will have all of his previous
				sins forgiven." (Related by al-Bukhari.) He also reported
				that the Prophet said, "When the imam recites, '...not of
				those with whom you are angered nor of those who have
				gone astray,' then say 'ameen (along with the imam), for
				the angels say 'ameen and the imam says 'ameen. If his

				morning prayer and the Friday prayer, and the first two
				rak'ah of the noon, afternoon, sunset and night prayers,
				and in all of the rak'ah of the superogatory prayers. Abu
				Qatadah reported that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				would recite al-Fatihah and some surah in the first two
				rak'ah of the noon prayer, and only al-Fatihah in the
				last two rak'ah. Sometimes he would recite some verses.
				The first rak'ah's recital would be longer than the

				Jabir ibn Sumrah reported that the people of Kufah
				complained about Sa'd to 'Umar, causing 'Umar to dismiss
				him and replace him with 'Ammar. They had many complaints
				about Sa'd, even claiming that he did not pray properly.
				'Umar sent for him and said, "O Abu Ishaq (Sa'd), these
				people claim that you do not pray properly." Sa'd
				replied, "By Allah, I prayed with them in the same manner
				that the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, prayed
				with us, and I never shortened it in any way. I would
				lengthen the first two rak'ah of the night prayer and
				shorten the last two." Said 'Umar, "This is what I
				expected of you." He sent him back to Kufah with one or
				two people to ask the people of Kufah about him. All of
				the people praised him until they went to the mosque of
				the tribe of 'Abs. A man named Usamah ibn Qatadah, also
				known as Abu Sa'da, stood and said, "Since I am under
				oath I must inform you that Sa'd never accompanied the
				army, did not distribute the booty justly, and was not
				just in his legal verdicts. Sa'd then said, "I pray to
				Allah for three things: O Allah, if this slave of Yours
				is lying and stood only for show, then give him a long
				life, increase his poverty and put him to trials." Years
				later, when Usamah was asked how he was doing, he would
				answer that he was an old man in trial due to Sa'd's
				supplication. 'Abdul-Malik (one of the narrators) said
				that he had seen the man afterwards with his eyebrows
				overhanging his eyes due to old age, and he would tease
				and assault the young girls along the paths. (Related by

				Al-Hussain, "In the fighting at Khorasan we had three
				hundred companions with us, and one of them would lead
				the prayer, recite some verses from the Qur'an and then
				bow." It is related that Ibn 'Abbas would recite
				al-Fatihah and some verses from al-Baqarah in every
				rak'ah. (Related by ad-Daraqutni with a strong chain.)
				Al-Baihaqi narrates from 'Abdullah ibn as-Sa'ib that the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, recited al-Mu'minun in the
				morning prayer, and when he came to the part which refers
				to Moses, Aaron or Jesus, he would cough and bow." 'Umar
				read in the first rak'ah 120 verses from the seven long
				surahs (Mathnawi). Al-Ahnaf read al-Kahfin the first
				rak'ah and Yunus or Yusufin the second, and said that he
				prayed the morning prayer with 'Umar (and he recited
				them). Ibn Mas'ud read forty verses from al-Anfal in the
				first rak'ah and a surah from the ten short surahs
				(Mufassil) in the second. Qatadah reported about a person
				who read one surah in two rak'ah or repeated the same
				surah twice, and then commented: 'It is all the Book of
				Allah." 'Ubaidullah ibn Thabit related that Anas said,
				"One of the helpers (Ansar) led the people in prayer at
				(the mosque) of Quba'. Before he began his recitation he
				would always recite, 'Say: He is Allah, the One,' until
				he finished that surah, and then he would recite another
				surah. He did that in every rak'ah. They said to him,
				'You begin with that surah, but we don't find it
				sufficient until you add another surah to it?' He said,
				'I will not stop doing so. I like to lead you in the
				prayer with that. If you don't like it, I will leave
				(leading you in the prayers).' They thought that he was
				the best among them, so they didn't want someone else to
				lead them. They referred the matter to the Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, and he said, 'O so and so, what has kept
				you from doing what your companions have asked you? Why
				do you keep reciting that surah in every rak'ah?' He
				said, 'I love that surah.' The Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, said, 'Your love for that surah will cause you to
				enter Paradise." A man from the tribe of Juhinah reported
				that he heard the Prophet, upon whom be peace, recite,
				"When the earth quakes," in the morning prayer in both

				He would read from sixty to one hundred verses during the
				morning prayer. Sometimes he would read surah Qal;
				ar-Rum, at-'Takwir, or az-Zilzal in the last two rak'ah.
				While travelling, he would sometimes read the last two
				surahs of the Qur'an. Sometimes he would read the first
				portion of al-Mu'minun until he would reach the story of
				Moses and Aaron in the first rak'ah, and then he would
				cough and bow. On Fridays he would read Alif; Lam, Mim,
				Tanzil as-Sajdah, or ad-Dahr in their complete forms. He
				did not do what many people do today, which is reciting
				part of this surah and part of another. Many ignorant
				people think that it is best to recite something with a
				prostration on Friday morning. But this is just plain
				ignorance. Some scholars dislike that one should read a
				surah with a prostration due to this ignorant thought.
				The Prophet, upon whom be peace, used to recite these two
				surahs because they contained reminders of man's
				creation, the return unto Allah, the creation of Adam,
				the entry into Paradise and Hell-fire, and other matters
				that did or will specifically occur on a Friday.
				Therefore, he would recite them on Friday to remind his

				importance like Friday, the 'Id days, and so on.

				He would recite Qafor al-Qamar completely, and sometimes

				the same. Once Abu Bakr read al-Baqarah in the morning
				prayer until the sun was about to rise. They said, "O
				successor of the Messenger of Allah, the sun is about to
				rise." He said, "Had it risen, you would not have found
				us negligent." 'Umar would recite Yusuf, an-Nahl, Hud,
				al-Isra' and similar surahs. If reciting long surahs was
				abrogated, it would have been known to the khalifahs or
				to those who may have criticized them. Muslim records
				from Jabir ibn Sumrah that the Messenger of Allah, upon
				whom be peace, recited Qaf in the morning prayer, and
				that his subsequent prayers during that day would be
				shorter. Umm al-Fadhl heard Ibn 'Abbas recite al-Mursilat
				and she told him, "O my son, that recital reminded me of

				Given the above, we may now interpret the Prophet's

				complete." 'Easiness' or 'lightness' is a relative term.
				We must return to how the Prophet behaved to understand
				and follow his example correctly. It is not to be
				determined by the whims and desires of those who are
				present for prayer. The Prophet, upon whom be peace, did
				not order the people to differ from his practice, even
				though he knew that behind him were the aged, weak and
				people with needs to tend to. He performed his prayer in
				the same manner that he asked others to pray--'light' or
				'easy'. If his prayers were somewhat long, they were
				still easy compared to how long he could have made them.
				The guidance that he came with and practiced is the one
				that decides our affairs and disputes for us. This is
				supported by the hadith recorded by an-Nasa'i and others
				in which Ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet, upon whom
				be peace, ordered those who lead prayers to be 'easy' by
				reciting as-Saffat. Therefore, a surah the length of

			<p>
				The Prophet, upon whom be peace, did not confine his
				recitation of the Qur'an in prayers to some specific
				surahs, (except for the Friday and 'Id prayers).
				Concerning the other prayers, Abu Dawud has recorded a
				hadith from 'Amr ibn Shu'aib from his father on the
				authority of his grandfather who said, "There is no
				separate surah, large or small, except the ones I heard
				the Prophet recite while leading the people in one of the
				obligatory prayers. He used to recite the entire surah in
				two rak'ahs, or just the initial part of the surah. It
				has not been recorded from him that he would recite from
				the middle or the end of the surah, nor that he would
				recite two surahs in one rak'ah during the obligatory
				prayers. He would, however, do so during voluntary
				prayers. Said Ibn Mas'ud, "I know the surahs the Prophet
				used to recite together in one rak'ah: ar-Rahman and
				an-Najm, al-Qamar and al-Haqqah, at-Tur and adh-Dhariyat,
				al-Waqi'ah and Noon, and so on." But this hadith does not
				tell us if this was during obligatory or voluntary
				prayers. The latter is more probable. He rarely recited
				one surah in two (both) rak'ahs. Abu Dawud records that a
				man from the tribe of Juhainah heard the Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, recite the complete surah az-Zil~al twice
				in both rak'ahs of the morning prayer. The man commented,
				"I do not know if he did this out of forgetfulness or if

				The Prophet, upon whom be peace, would make the first
				rak'ah of the morning prayer longer than the second. At
				times, he would continue to prolong his recitation until
				he heard no more footsteps (of the people coming to catch
				the prayer). He made the morning prayer the longest of
				his (obligatory) prayers. This is because its recitation
				is witnessed by Allah and the angels. It is also stated
				that it is witnessed by both the angels who record the
				daytime deeds and those who record the nighttime deeds.
				Whether it is Allah and His angels or His angels alone
				who witness that time, or does it continue until the
				morning prayer is over or until the sun rises cannot be
				said with certainty, though both of the statements are
				correct.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, since the morning prayer has the least
				number of rak'ah, the recitation is prolonged to
				compensate for it. It is prayed right after sleep. As
				such, people are well rested. Also, it occurs before they
				have engaged themselves in their livelihood and other
				worldly affairs. The spirit as well as the body is
				responsive to the words of Allah. This makes the recital
				easier to ponder over and comprehend. Also, prayer is the
				basis and the first of all works. Therefore, it is
				preferred to prolong the recital of the morning prayer.

				It is sunnah to make one's voice beautiful and nice while

				said, "Beautify your voices with the Qur'an." He also
				said, "He is not one of us who does not chant the
				Qur'an," "The one with the best voice with the Qur'an is
				the one that when you hear him, you feel that he fears
				Allah," and "Allah never listened to anything like he
				listened to his Prophet chanting the Qur'an with a
				beautiful voice."
			</p>
			<p>
				Says an-Nawawi, "It is sunnah for anyone who is reciting
				the Qur'an, whether he is praying or not, to ask Allah
				for His blessings when he comes to a verse of mercy. When
				he comes to a verse (describing) punishment, he should
				seek refuge in Allah from Hellfire, punishment, evil,
				from what is hated, or he may say, "Allah, I ask You for
				well-being, etc." When he comes to a verse that glorifies
				or exalts Allah, he should say, "Glory be to Allah," or
				"Blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Worlds," and so on.
				Hudhaifah ibn al-Yaman is reported to have said, "I
				prayed with the Prophet, upon whom be peace, one night,
				and he started reading al-Baqarah. I said to myself, 'He
				will bow after one hundred verses,' but he continued.
				Then I said, 'He will complete it and bow,' but he moved
				to recite very slowly al 'Imran and then an-Nisa'. When
				he came to a verse glorifying Allah, he would glorify
				Him. If he came to a verse that mentioned a request, he
				would request it. If he came to something that (one
				should) seek refuge from, he would seek refuge." This was
				related by Muslim. Among the Shafiyyah, the glorifying,
				requesting and seeking refuge should be done during the
				prayer and at other times. The imam, followers and one
				praying by himself should all do so, for they are
				supplications that one should say, like 'ameen. It is
				preferred that when reading, "Is not Allah the most
				conclusive of all judges?" / at-Tin:8 / one should say,
				"Certainly, and I am one of the witnesses to that. When
				one reads, "Is not He (who does so) able to bring the
				dead to life? / al-Qiyamah:40 /, he should say,
				"Certainly, and I bear witness (to it)." When one reads,
				"Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High," (
				al-A'la: 1 ), he should say, "Glory to my Lord, the Most
				High." That should be said during prayer and otherwise.

				One's prayer is not accepted unless al-Fatihah is recited
				in every rak'ah. But, one who is praying behind an imam
				is to keep quiet while the imam is reciting aloud, as
				Allah says in the Qur'an, "When the Qur'an is recited,
				listen and remain silent that you may attain mercy." The
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, also said, "When the imam
				makes the takbir, (you too) make the takbir. When he
				recites, be silent." (Related by Muslim.) One hadith
				states, "Whoever is praying behind an imam, the imam's
				recital is his recital. If the imam reads quietly, then
				all of the followers must also make their own recital. If
				one cannot hear the imam's recital, he must make his own
				recital.
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on this subject, Abu Bakr al-'Arabi says,
				"What we see as the strongest opinion is that one must
				recite during the prayers in which the imam's recital is
				subdued. But, during the prayers where the imam recites
				aloud, one may not recite. This is based on the following
				three proofs: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					This was the practice of the people of Madinah,
				</li>
				<li>
					it is the ruling of the Qur'an, as Allah says,
					"When the Qur'an is recited, listen and remain
					silent," and
				</li>
				<li>
					this is supported by two hadith: one from 'Imran
					ibn Hussain states, 'I know that some of you
					compete with me (in my recital...),' and 'If it
					is recited, you should listen.' The preceding
					hadith is the weightiest position according to
					the following argument: If one cannot recite
					along with the imam, then when can one recite? If
					one says, 'While he is silent,' then we say, 'It
					is not necessary for him to be silent,'7 so how
					can something that is obligatory be dependent on
					something that is not obligatory? But we have
					found a way in which the person may 'recite' with
					the imam, and that is the recitation of the heart
					and of concentrating on what is being recited.
					This is the method of the Qur'an and the hadith,
					and the way the worship has been preserved. It is
					also part of following the sunnah. One is to act
					by what is the strongest (opinion). This was also
					the choice of az-Zuhri and Ibn al-Mubarak, and it
					is a statement from Malik, Ahmad and Ishaq. Ibn

				the imam, follower or praying by himself, to say, "Allah
				hears him who praises Him," upon coming up from the
				bowing. When he is standing straight, he should say, "Our
				Lord, and to You is the praise," or "O Allah, Our Lord,
				and to You is the praise." Abu Hurairah reported that
				when the Prophet, upon whom be peace, rose from bowing he
				would say, "Allah hears him who praises Him," and while
				standing (straight) he would say, "Our Lord, and to You
				is the praise." (Related by Ahmad, al-Bukhari and
				Muslim.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Bukhari records in the hadith from Anas, "When he
				says, 'Allah hears him who praises Him,' you say, 'O
				Allah, our Lord, and to You is the praise." Ahmad and
				others record a hadith from Abu Hurairah in which the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, is quoted as saying, "When
				the imam says, 'Allah hears him who praises Him,' you
				say, 'O Allah, our Lord, and to You is the praise.' If
				one's statement corresponds to that of the angels, all of
				his previous sins will be forgiven." The Prophet said,
				"Pray as you have seen me pray." This applies to all of
				his glorifying and praise statements, even if the person
				is following the imam. The answer to those who say, 'One
				should not combine both of these sayings' ('Allah hears
				him...' and 'O Allah, our Lord...') but only say the one
				of praise, has been given by an-Nawawi who said, "Our
				companions say that the mentioning of the command, 'And
				you should say, O Allah, our Lord...' is in conjunction
				with 'Allah hears him who praises him.' But the Prophet,
				upon whom be peace, only mentioned the statement, 'O
				Allah, Our Lord, to you is the praise,' because they had
				already heard the statement, 'Allah hears him who praises
				Him' aloud from him. It was his sunnah to say that phrase
				aloud, but they did not hear him say, 'Our Lord, to You
				is the praise' because he said it in a subdued voice.
				They knew the Prophet's words, 'Pray as you have seen me
				pray,' and knew that it was to be taken in the general
				sense without any restrictions. They used to say, 'Allah
				hears him who praises Him,' and therefore there was no
				need for the Prophet, upon whom be peace, to order them
				to say it again. But they did not know, 'Our Lord, to You
				is the praise,' and therefore he ordered them to say it."
			</p>
			<p>
				The two phrases are the least that one should say while
				standing. But one may add any of the supplicatory words
				mentioned in the following hadith:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Said Raf ah ibn Rafa', "One day we prayed behind
					the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace. When
					he raised his head from bowing, he said, 'Allah
					hears him who praises Him,' and a man behind him
					said, 'Our Lord, to You is the praise, as much as
					it can be and as blessed as it can be.' When the
					Prophet, upon whom be peace, finished the prayer
					he said, 'Who said that phrase earlier?' A man
					said, 'I did, O Messenger of Allah.' The Prophet
					said, 'I saw more than thirty angels chasing
					after you to see who would record it first."'
					(Related by Ahmad, al-Bukhari, Malik and Abu
					Dawud.)
				</li>
				<li>
					'Ali reported that when the Prophet raised his
					head from bowing he would say, "Allah hears him
					who praises Him, and to You is the praise filling
					up the heavens and the earth, what is between
					them and filling up whatever You wish in addition
					to that." (Related by Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Dawud
					and at-Tirmidhi.)
				</li>
				<li>
					'Abdullah ibn Abu 'Aufa reported that when the
					Prophet raised his head from bowing he would say,
					"O Allah, to You is the praise filling up the
					skies and the earth and filling up whatever You
					wish in addition to that. O Allah, purify me with
					snow, hail and cold water. O Allah, purify me
					from sins and cleanse me from them as one cleans
					a white garment from filth." (Related by Ahmad,
					Muslim, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Said Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri, "When the Prophet,
					upon whom be peace, would say, 'Allah hears him
					who praises Him,' he would (also) say, 'O Allah,
					to You is the praise filling up the skies and the
					earth, and filling up what You wish in addition
					to that. You are the One who is worthy of praise
					and glory. This is the most correct statement
					that a slave could make. And we are all slaves
					unto You. There is no one who can prevent what
					You have given. And there is no one who can give
					what You have prevented. No one can benefit from
					fortune (in the face of) Your fortune."' (Related
					by Muslim, Ahmad and Abu Dawud.)
				</li>
				<li>
					It has also been authentically reported from the
					Prophet, upon whom be peace, that after saying
					"Allah hears him who praises Him," he would say,
					"To my Lord is the praise, to my Lord is the
					praise," until he would be standing for as long
					as he was bowing.

			<p>
				Most scholars prefer that one place his knees on the
				floor before his hands. Ibn al-Mundhir related this from
				'Umar an-Nakha'i, Muslim ibn Yasar, Sufyan al-Thauri,
				Ahmad, Ishaq and other jurists including Ibn al-Mundhir
				himself. Abu at-Tayyeb said that most jurists agree with
				this. Ibn al-Qayyim said, "When the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, prayed, he would place his knees (on the floor)
				before his hands, then his hands, his forehead and nose.
				This is what is authentic and has been related by Shuraik
				from 'Asim ibn Kaleeb on the authority of his father from
				Wa'il ibn Hajr who said, 'I saw the Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, while prostrating, placing his knees
				(on the floor) before his hands. Upon getting up, he
				would raise his hands before his knees. I never saw him
				do otherwise." Malik, al-Auza'i, Ibn Hazm and Ahmad
				maintain that it is preferred to place the hands down
				first and then the knees. Says al-Auza'i, "I saw the
				people placing their hands on the floor before their
				knees." Ibn Abu Dawud comments, "That is the statement of
				the people of hadith." There is also a difference of
				opinion concerning how one should stand up from the
				prostration after the first (or third) rak'ah. Some say
				one should raise the hands from the floor first while
				others say that one should raise the knees first.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is preferred for the one who is prostrating to follow
				the following points:
			</p>
			<p>
				One should place one's nose, forehead and hands upon the
				floor
			</p>
			<p>
				They should be separated from the sides of the body.
				Wa'il ibn Hajr reported that when the Messenger of Allah
				prostrated, he would place his forehead between his palms
				and separate his arms from the sides of his body.
				(Related by Abu Dawud.) Abu Humaid reported that when the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, prostrated, he would place
				his nose and forehead upon the floor, keep his arms away
				from his sides, and place his hands parallel to his
				shoulders. This is related by Ibn Khuzaimah and
				at-Tirmidhi, who called it hassan sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				One should place one's hands parallel to one's ears or
				shoulders
			</p>
			<p>
				As both of these acts have been related. Some scholars
				combine these two acts by placing the ends of the thumbs
				parallel to the ears and the palms parallel to the
				shoulders.
			</p>
			<p>
				One should have one's fingers together and stretched out
			</p>
			<p>
				AlHakim and Ibn Hibban record that when the Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, bowed he would have his fingers separated
				and when he prostrated he would keep his fingers
				together.
			</p>
			<p>
				One should have one's fingers facing the qiblah
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Humaid that when the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, prostrated, his fingers
				would be neither spread out nor clasped together, and his
				toes would be directed toward the qiblah.

				It is preferred for the one who is prostrating to say
				Subhana Rabiyy al-A'la (Glory to my Lord, the Most High).
				'Uqbah ibn 'Aamr related that when, "Glorify the name of
				your Lord, the Most High" was revealed, the Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, said, "Do so in your prostrations." This
				is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and al-Hakim.
				Its chain is good.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hudhaifah reported that when the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, prostrated, he would say "Subhana Rabiyy al-A'la.
				" This is related by Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Dawud, an-Nasa'i,
				Ibn Majah and at-Tirmidhi, who called it hassan sahih. It
				is a must that one not repeat these sayings less than
				three times during the bowings and prostrations. Says
				at-Tirmidhi, "The scholars prefer the one bowing or
				prostrating to make the glorifications at least three
				times." According to the majority, the minimum that is
				sufficient for the prostrations or bowings is one
				glorification. We have already mentioned that "calmness"
				is obligatory, and this requires a time of at least one
				glorification.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to some scholars, the complete glorification is
				ten. This is based on the following hadith: Sa'eed ibn
				Jubair related that Anas said, "I have not seen anyone
				being more similar to the Prophet's prayer than this boy
				('Umar ibn 'Abdul-'Aziz). We estimated the number of the
				glorifications that he made during his bowing to be ten
				and in his prostrations also to be ten." This is related
				by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and an-Nasa'i with a good chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on the subject, ash-Shaukani says, "Some hold
				that this proves that the complete (number of)
				glorifications is ten. The more sound opinion is that an
				individual who is praying may offer as many
				glorifications as he wishes. There are authentic hadith
				that state that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				elongated his glorifications during prostrations. The
				imam may also do so if he knows the followers will not
				get tired by making it longer."
			</p>
			<p>
				Says Ibn 'Abdul-Barr, "It is a must that every imam
				should be easy (by not making the prayers too long) as
				has been ordered by the Prophet, even if he knows that
				those behind him are strong, because he does not know
				what may have happened to them and what needs they may
				have to tend to."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Mubarak maintains, "It is preferred for the imam
				to make five glorifications. Therefore, all the people
				behind him would be able to make (at least) three. It is
				preferred that one not limit his remembrance during the
				prostrations to just the glorifications, but he should
				add some supplications to it. In an authentic hadith, it
				is recorded that the Prophet said, 'The closest one of
				you comes to his Lord is while he is prostrating,
				(therefore) make many supplications therein.' And he also
				said, 'I have prohibited you from reciting while bowing
				or prostrating. During the bowing, glorify the Lord.
				During the prostrations, strive your hardest in making
				supplications. Most likely, you will be listened to."
				This was related by Ahmad and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many hadith are related on this topic, including:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					'Ali reported that when the Prophet prostrated he
					would say, "O Allah, to You have I prostrated, in
					You have I believed, and to You have I submitted.
					I have prostrated my face to the One who created
					me and formed me in the best of forms. He is the
					One who gave it hearing and sight. Blessed be
					Allah, the Best of Creators." (Related by Ahmad
					and Muslim.)
				</li>
				<li>
					While describing the Prophet's late night
					prayers, Ibn 'Abbas said, "Then he would go to
					pray and during his prayer or prostration, he
					would say, 'O Allah, place light in my heart, in
					my hearing, in my sight, on my right, on my left,
					in front of me, behind me, above me, below me,
					and make me light." Reported Shu'bah, "Or he
					said, 'And make for me light." (Related by
					Muslim, Ahmad and others.)
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Talking of light, an-Nawawi observes, "The scholars say
				that asking for light for all organs and sides means
				(asking) to have the truth and guidance made clear for
				one's self. He asked for this so that there would be no
				deviation or misguidance left in him."

			<p>
				It is sunnah to sit "spread out" between the two
				prostrations (to put the left foot down and to sit upon
				it and to keep the right foot upright with the toes
				pointing toward the qiblah). 'Aishah reported that the
				Prophet would lay out his left foot and keep his right
				foot upright. (Related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.) Ibn
				'Umar reported that it is from the sunnah to keep the
				right foot upright, with its toes pointing toward the
				qiblah, and to sit upon the left foot. (Related by
				an-Nasa'i.) Reported Nafa', "When Ibn 'Umar prayed, he
				would face the qiblah, even his shoes." (Reported by
				al-Athram.) In the hadith of Abu Humaid, in which he
				described the prayer of the Prophet, he stated, "Then he
				would lay down his left foot and sit upon it until all of
				his bones were in place, and then he would go to make the
				prostration (again)." (Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and
				at-Tirmidhi who classified it as sahih.)
			</p>
			<p>
				It has also been related that ifa'a (laying out both feet
				and sitting upon one's heels) is a preferred act.
				Comments Abu 'Ubaidah, "This is the statement of the
				people of hadith." Abu az-Zubair related that he heard
				Tawus say, "We asked Ibn 'Abbas about ifa'a, and he said,
				'It is sunnah to do so.' We said, 'We think it to be too
				harsh for the man.' He said, 'It is a sunnah of your
				Prophet, upon whom be peace." (Related by Muslim.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar reported that when the Prophet rose from the
				first prostration, he would sit upon his toes. He used to
				say, "That is from the sunnah." Reported Tawus, "I saw
				the 'Abdullahs ('Abdullah ibn 'Abbas, 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar
				and 'Abdullah ibn az-Zubair) sitting with their feet laid
				flat." The last two reports were related by al-Baihaqi.
				Talking of its authenticity, Ibn Hajr says, "Its chain is
				sound."
			</p>
			<p>
				Concerning iqa'a--sitting with the buttocks on the ground
				and with the thighs straight on the ground--it is
				disliked by all scholars. Said Abu Hurairah, "The Prophet
				prohibited us from three things: pecking like a rooster
				(making the prostration very quickly), sitting like a dog
				(iqa 'a), and not turning one's whole head like a fox."
				This is related by Ahmad, al-Baihaqi, at-Tabarani and Abu
				Tala with a hassan chain. It is preferred for the one who
				is sitting between the two prostrations to put his right
				hand on his right thigh and his left hand on his left
				thigh with the fingers stretched out and directed toward
				the qiblah. The fingers should be slightly separated and
				should not go beyond the knees.

				This refers to a quick sitting that one makes after the
				second prostration of the first and third rak'ah. The
				scholars differ over this regulation due to the differing
				hadith. Says Ibn al-Qayyim, "The jurists differ over this
				act. Is it a sunnah of the prayer that one should
				perform, or is it only done due to some necessity? There
				are two statements on this question and two narrations
				from Ahmad. Said al-Khallal, 'Ahmad referred to the
				hadith of Malik ibn al-Huwairith regarding the
				intermediate position of rest (between the two
				prostrations). He said, 'Yusuf ibn Musa informed me that
				Abu Umamah was asked about standing up (in the prayer)
				and he said, 'It should be done on the tops of the feet
				according to the hadith of Rafa'.' In the hadith of Ibn
				'Ajlan there is no proof that he would stand on the tips
				of his feet. Many of the companions and others who
				described the prayers of the Prophet did not mention this
				sitting, except in what is related by Abu Humaid and
				Malik ibn al-Huwairith. If it was part of his guidance,
				he would always do it, and those who described his

			<p>

				One should sit for the tashahud and place his hands in
				the following manner:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Ibn 'Umar reported that when the Prophet sat for
					the tashahud, he would place his left hand on his
					left knee and his right hand upon his right knee,
					and he would form a ring like (fifty-three) and
					point with his index finger. In another narration
					it is reported, "He would close his hand and
					point with his index finger." (Related by
					Muslim.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Wa'il ibn Hajr reported that the Prophet would
					place his left palm on his left thigh and knee.
					He would place the end of his right elbow upon
					his right thigh and would then close his right
					hand, forming a circle. In another narration it
					states, "He would make a circle with his middle
					finger and thumb and point with his index finger.
					Then he would raise his finger, and (Wa'il) saw
					him moving it to make supplications." (Related by
					Ahmad.) Explaining the hadith, al-Baihaqi says,
					"The implication of 'he would move it' is that he
					would point with it, not that he would continue
					to move it." This would be in agreement with the
					narration of Ibn az-Zubair who reported, "The
					Prophet would point with his finger while
					supplicating, and he would not move it." This is
					related by Abu Dawud with a sahih chain.
					An-Nawawi also mentioned it.
				</li>
				<li>
					Reported az-Zubair, "When the Prophet sat for
					tashahud, he would place his right hand on his
					right thigh and his left hand on his left thigh.
					He would point with his middle finger, and would
					not look beyond his pointing." (Related by Ahmad,
					Muslim and anNasa'i.) This hadith shows that one
					is to place the right hand on the right thigh
					without closing the hand (making a fist), and
					that he is not to look beyond his pointing.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The preceding three hadith are all authentic, and one may
				act by any of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				One should point with one's right index finger, bending
				it a little, until one says the salaams at the end of the
				prayer. Reported Numair al-Khaza'i, "I saw the Messenger
				of Allah sitting in the prayer with his forearm along his
				right thigh. His index finger was raised, curved (or
				bent) a little, and he was supplicating." This is related
				by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, an-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah and Ibn
				Khuzaimah with a good chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				Said Anas ibn Malik, "The Messenger of Allah, upon whom
				be peace, passed by Sa'd while he was making
				supplications (and using) two fingers. The Prophet said
				to him, 'Just one, Sa'd"' This is related by Ahmed, Abu
				Dawud, an-Nasa'i and al-Hakim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas was asked about a man who pointed with his
				finger while supplicating, and he said, "This is sincere
				devotion." Says Anas ibn Malik, "That is imploring."
				Mujahid maintains "Doing this hinders Satan." According
				to the Shai'iyyah, one points with the finger only once,
				when saying "except Allah" in the statement bearing
				witness. The Hanifiyyah raise the finger in the denial
				part of the statement (there is no god) and put it back
				down during the confirmation part (except Allah). The
				Malikiyyah move the finger to the left and right until
				they finish the prayer. The Hanbaliyyah point with the
				finger every time they mention Allah, as a reflection of
				the oneness of Allah, and they do not move it.

				When Abu Humaid described the prayer of the Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, he said, "When he sat after two rak'ah, he
				would sit upon his left leg and keep his right foot
				upright. When he sat for the last rak'ah, he would pull
				over his left foot and put his right foot upright (over
				the left foot) and sit upon his entire posterior."
				(Related by al-Bukhari.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Most scholars say that the first tashahud is sunnah
			</p>
			<p>
				This is based on the hadith of 'Abdullah ibn Buhainah who
				reported that once the Prophet stood during the noon
				prayer when he should have sat ( for the first tashahud).
				When he finished the prayer, he made two prostrations. He
				made a takbir for each prostration (and it was) while he
				was sitting before he made the tasleem. He made those two
				prostrations because he had forgotten to sit (for the
				first tashahud). (Related by "the group.")
			</p>
			<p>
				In Subul as-Salaam, it is stated that this hadith proves
				that one who forgets the first tashah ud must make the
				prostrations of forgetfulness. The Prophet is, however,
				reported to have said, "Pray as you have seen me pray."
				This would point to the first tashahud being obligatory,
				and one would have to do some act to make up for it. But,
				this also proves that it is not obligatory, for if one
				misses an act that is obligatory, the two prostrations of
				foregetfulness are not sufficient to make up for it. That
				is what Ibn Hajr says in Fath al-Bari.
			</p>
			<p>
				Says Ibn Batal, "The proof is that the two prostrations
				due to forgetfulness cannot replace something that is
				obligatory. If one forgets the opening takbir, they will
				not replace it. In the case of the tashahud, it is a
				remembrance that is not said aloud and it is not
				obligatory." Some say otherwise, because the Prophet used
				to perform it and, as such, he let others follow him in
				performing it after he found out that they were leaving
				it intentionally. But there is some doubt about this
				argument. Those who say that it is obligatory include
				al-Laith Ibn Sa'd, Ishaq, ash-Shaf'i and the Hanafiyyah.
				At-Tabari argues that it is obligatory because originally
				only two rak'ah and the tashahud were obligatory. When
				they were made longer, the original obligations were not
				done away with. Therefore, it is still obligatory.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is preferred to make the first tashahud quickly
			</p>
			<p>
				Reported Ibn Mas'ud, "When the Prophet sat after the
				first two rak'ah, it seemed as if he was (sitting) on hot
				stones." This is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, an-Nasa'i,
				at-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi grades it as
				hassan and says, 'Ubaidah (ibn 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud) did
				not hear (hadith) from his father. He also says, "The
				scholars act according to this hadith. They prefer that
				one should not sit too long after the first two rak'ah,
				and that he should not add anything to the tashahud."
			</p>
			<p>
				Says Ibn al-Qayyim, "It is not reported from the Prophet
				that he would say prayers upon himself or his family
				during the first tashahud. Nor would he seek refuge from
				the torment of the grave or the Hell-fire, or from the
				test of life, death and of the false Messiah. Those who
				say such supplications are deducing their arguments from
				the general application (of the supplications and the
				word tashahud), but the correct position is that their
				proper place is in the last tashahud.

				The salutations upon the Prophet, upon whom be peace, is
				a preferred act and is not obligatory. This contention is
				based on a hadith recorded by at-Tirmidhi (who said it is
				sahih), Ahmad and Abu Dawud from Fidhalah ibn 'Ubaid who
				said, "The Messenger of Allah heard a man supplicating in
				his prayer and he did not make the prayers on the
				Prophet. The Prophet said, 'He has hastened.'
			</p>
			<p>
				Then he called him and said, 'When one of you prays,
				begin with the praise and lauding of Allah. Then make
				prayers upon the Prophet, and supplicate whatever you
				wish of Allah." The author of al-Muntaqi says, "This is a
				proof for those who say that the prayers upon the Prophet
				are not obligatory, because he did not order the one who
				did not do it to repeat his prayer. This is supported by
				his statement to Ibn Mas'ud, after mentioning (only) the
				tashahud, 'Then choose whatever you wish to ask (of
				Allah)." In his comments on this hadith, ash-Shaukani
				observes, "In my opinion, there is no confirmed proof
				that it is obligatory."

				It is preferred for the person to supplicate after the

				(that end the prayer). The person may ask for whatever he
				wishes of the good of this life and the hereafter. Ibn
				Mas'ud reported that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,

				Supplications are preferred acts in general, regardless

				<li>
					Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of
					Allah, upon whom be peace, said, "When one of you
					finishes the final tashahud, he should say, 'O
					Allah, I seek refuge in You from the torment of
					the Hell-fire and the grave, from the trials of
					life and death, and from the trials of the false
					Messiah." (Related by Muslim.)
				</li>
				<li>
					'Aishah reported that the Messenger of Allah
					would supplicate in his prayer, "O Allah, I seek
					refuge in You from the torment of the grave, from
					the trials of the anti-Christ, and from the
					trials of life and death. Allah, I seek refuge in
					You from sin and debt." (Related by Muslim and
					al-Bukhari.)
				</li>
				<li>
					'Ali reported that when the Prophet prayed, the
					last thing he would say between the tashahud and
					the tasleem was, "O Allah, forgive my past and
					later sins, what was in private and what was in
					public, and what I have been extravagant in. You
					are more knowledgeable of it than I. You are the
					Promoter and the Retarder. There is no god except
					You." (Related by Muslim.)
				</li>
				<li>
					'Abdullah ibn 'Amr reported that Abu Bakr said to
					the Messenger of Allah, "Teach me a supplication
					that I may use in my prayers." He told him, "Say,
					O Allah, I have wronged my soul a great wrong and
					no one forgives sins except You, so forgive me
					with such forgiveness that only comes from You
					and have mercy on me. Verily, You are the
					Oft-Forgiving, the Oft-Mercful." (Related by
					al-Bukhari and Muslim.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Handhalah ibn 'Ali said that Muhjan ibn al-Adra'
					related to him that the Prophet entered the
					mosque while a man was just about to finish his
					prayer. The latter made the tashahud and said, "O
					Allah, I am asking You, O Allah, the One, the
					Only, the Absolute, who begets nor is begotten,
					nor is anyone like Him, to forgive my sins, for
					You are the Forgiving, the Merciful." The Prophet
					then said three times, "He has been forgiven."
					(Related by Ahmad and Abu Dawud.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Shaddad ibn Aus reported that during his prayer,
					the Prophet would say, "O Allah, I ask You to
					confirm me in the affairs, to keep me on the
					correct path, to make me thankful for your
					blessings and excellent in Your worship. O Allah,
					I ask You for a tranquil heart and truthful
					tongue. O Allah, I ask You for the good of what
					You know, and I seek refuge in You from the evil
					of which you are aware, and I ask Your
					forgiveness from what You know." (Related by
					an-Nasa'i.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Said Abu Mijlaz, " 'Ammar ibn Yasar led us in the
					prayer and he made it very short. The people
					blamed him for that and he told them, 'Did I not
					complete my bowings and prostrations ... and did
					I not supplicate therein what the Prophet used to
					supplicate, saying, 'O Allah by Your knowledge of
					the unseen and Your power over the creation, let
					me live if You know that living is best for me,
					and let me die if You know that dying is better
					for me. I ask You (to forgive me) for fear of You
					in what is not seen and what is seen, to make my
					speech truthful while angry or pleased, and to
					have the same aim in poverty and riches. Grant me
					the pleasure of looking to Your face and of the
					longing to meet You. I seek refuge in You from a
					harmful loss and from the trials of a misguider.
					O Allah, embellish me with the beauty of faith,
					and make us of the guided of the guiders." This
					is related by Ahmad and an-Nasa'i with a good
					chain.
				</li>
				<li>
					Abu Saleh related from one of the companions that
					the Prophet said to a man, "What do you say in
					your prayer?" He said, "I say the tashahud and
					then I say, 'O Allah, I ask of you Paradise and
					seek refuge in You from Hell-fire.' But I cannot
					murmer as good as you or Mu'adh (as eloquent as
					you are)." The Prophet said, "We ask concerning
					Paradise and the Hell-fire." (Related by Ahmad
					and Abu Dawud.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Ibn Mas'ud reported that the Prophet taught him
					to say this supplication: "O Allah, bring our
					hearts together and make our relations good.
					Guide us to the paths of peace and bring us out
					of the darkness and into the light. Keep us away
					from lewdness, both hidden and open. O Allah,
					bless us in our hearing and our sight, in our
					hearts, our wives and our offspring. Turn unto
					us, for You are the Oft-Turning, the
					Oft-Merciful. Make us thankful for Your blessings
					and complete it upon us." (Related by Ahmad and
					Abu Dawud.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Said Anas, "We were sitting with the Prophet and
					a man stood up and prayed. When he bowed and made
					the tashahud, he would supplicate, 'O Allah, I
					ask of You, for to You is the praise. There is no
					god except You, the Giver without question, the
					Creator of the heavens and the earth. O Sublime
					and Honorable One, O Living and Sustaining One, I
					ask of You.' The Prophet said to his companions,
					'Do you know who he made his supplication with?'
					They said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.'
					He said, 'By the One in whose hand is the soul of
					Muhammad, he supplicated Allah by His greatest
					name. If one supplicates by that name, it will be
					listened to. If he asks by it, it will be given."
					(Related by an-Nasa'i.)
				</li>
				<li>
					'Umair ibn Sa'd said, "Ibn Mas'ud used to teach
					us the tashahud of the prayer and then he would
					say, 'When one of you finishes the tashahud, he
					should say: O Allah, I ask you for all good, that

			<ol>
				<li>
					Reported Thauban, "When the Prophet would finish

					One day the Prophet took Mu'adh ibn Jabal's hand
					and said to him, "O Mu'adh, I love you." Mu'adh
					responded, "May my father and mother be

					Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of

			<p>
				At-tatawwu', or nawafil or supererogatory prayers, have
				been legislated to make up for any deficiencies left in
				the performance of fard salah (obligatory prayers). In
				salah, there are virtues that are not found in any other
				form of worship. Abu Hurairah reports that the Prophet
				sallallahu alehi wasallam said: "The first thing that the
				people will be called to account for on the Day of
				Resurrection will be the prayers. Our Lord will say to
				the angels although He knows better: 'Look into the salah
				of my servant to see if he observed it perfectly or been
				negligent in it. So if he observed it perfectly it will
				be recorded to his credit, but if he had been negligent
				in it in any way, Allah would say: See if My servant has
				any supererogatory prayers. Then if he has any
				supererogatory prayers, Allah would say: Make up the
				deficiency in My servant's obligatory prayer with his
				supererogatory prayers.' Thereafter all his actions will
				be examined in like manner" (Abu Dawud).
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Umamah narrates that the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam said: "Allah does not listen to anything from
				His slave as He does to the two rak'at (of prayer) that
				he offers. Mercy descends over the servant's head as long
				as he remains in prayer" (Ahmad and at-Tirmidhi).
				As-Sayuti grades it sahih. In al-Muwatta', Malik says:
				"It has reached me that the Prophet said: '(Try to) keep
				to the straight path although you won't be able to do so
				completely; and know that the best of your deeds is the
				salah, and only a (true) believer preserves his wudu.'"
				Muslim records from Rabi'ah ibn Malik al-Aslami that the
				Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam said: "Ask (anything)."
				Rabi'ah said: "I ask of you to be your companion in
				paradise." The Prophet said: "Or anything else?" Rabi'ah
				said: "That is it." The Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam
				said to him: "Then help me by making many prostrations

			</p>
			<p>
				These hadith prove that it is preferred to say one's

			</p>
			<p>
				An-Nawawi says: "If one decides to make nawafil prayers

				[of rak'at] he shall make, then he may end the prayer
				after one rak'ah or make it two rak'at or increase it to
				three or one hundred or one thousand, and so forth. If he
				prays a number of [rak'at], without knowing how many, and

				to ash-Shaf'i on this point.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Baihaqi records with a chain of narrators, that Abu
				Dharr prayed many rak'at and then concluded his salah.
				Al-Ahnaf ibn Qais asked him: "Do you know if you finished

				not leave the two rak'at of the fajr no matter what the
				excuse, even while under enemy attack or under most
				trying conditions. 'Aishah says: "The Messenger of Allah
				was not so particular about observing any supererogatory

				he took in recital was like what it takes to recite
				al-Fatihah. This is related by Ahmad, an-Nasa'i,
				al-Baihaqi, Malik, and at-Tahawi. It is preferred to

				most blessed surahs," and he would recite them in the two
				rak'at before salatul fajr. This is related by Ahmad and
				Ibn Majah. Jabir relates that a man stood to pray the two
				rak'at before the dawn prayer and recited "Say: O
				disbelievers!" in the first rak'ah until he finished the
				surah. The Prophet said: "That slave knows his Lord." In
				the second rak'ah he recited: "Say: He is Allah, the
				One"...to the end of the surah. The Prophet said: "That

				There is quite a difference of opinion over this point.
				Apparently, it is preferred for one to do so if one prays
				these sunnah rak'at in one's house and not in the mosque.
				Ibn Hajar says in Fath al-Bari: "Some of the early
				scholars were of the opinion that it is preferred to do
				so if one prays in one's house rather than in the
				mosque." This has been recorded from Ibn 'Umar. Some of
				our scholars reinforce this argument by stating that
				there is no evidence that the Prophet ever did so in the
				mosque. It has also been authentically recorded from Ibn
				'Umar that "he would throw pebbles at anyone who did so
				in the mosque," and this was related by Ibn Abi Shaibah.

				had finished salatul fajr, he prayed the two rak'at
				(sunnah) prayer. The Messenger of Allah passed by him and
				inquired: "What is this prayer?" Qais then informed him
				of all that had happened. The Prophet kept silent and did
				not say anything. This is related by Ahmad, Ibn

				mu'dhdhin to make the adhan. Then, the Prophet prayed the
				fajr sunnah, after which he ordered the iqamah to be made
				and prayed salatul fajr. It is apparent from this hadith
				that one is to make up the sunnah prayer before or after
				the sun rises, regardless of whether only sunnah prayer
				is missed or both sunnah and fard are missed, and whether
				there is a valid excuse or not. It may be made up by

				Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari relates: "The Prophet sallellahu
				alehi wasallam would make the witr prayer in the first
				part of the night or the middle of it or the latter part

			</p>
			<p>
				'Abdullah ibn Abi Qais relates that he asked 'Aishah
				about the witr prayer of the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam and she said: "Sometimes he would make the witr
				prayer in the first part of the night and sometimes he
				would make the witr prayer in the latter portion of the

				Sometimes he would be inaudible and sometimes audible.
				Sometimes he would make ghusl and sleep and sometimes he
				would make ablution and sleep [i.e., when he was sexually
				defiled]." This is related by Abu Dawud, Ahmad, Muslim,
				and at-Tirmidhi. It is preferred to pray it early if one
				suspects that one will not wake during the latter portion
				of the night. It is, on the other hand, advisable to
				delay it if one believes that one will be able to wake up
				during the latter portion of the night.
			</p>
			<p>
				If one suspects that one will not be able to perform the
				prayer in the latter portion of the night, it should be
				prayed during the early portion of the night (before
				sleeping).
			</p>
			<p>
				Jabir reports that the Messenger of Allah said: "Whoever

				prayer during the early part [of the night]. And whoever
				of you believes that he will be able to wake during the

				time [the angels are attentive to the prayers in the last
				portion of the night]." This is related by Ahmad, Muslim,
				atTirmidhi, and Ibn Majah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jabir also narrates that the Messenger of Allah inquired
				of Abu Bakr: "When do you perform the witr prayer?" Abu
				Bakr replied: "In the early portion of the night after
				the night prayer" Then the Prophet said: "And you, O
				'Umar?" He answered: "During the latter portion of the
				night." The Prophet said: "As for you, O Abu Bakr, you
				have taken the careful way. As for you, 'Umar, you have
				taken the way of hardship and firm will." This is related
				by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and al-Hakim who says it is sahih
				according to Muslim's criterion. However, the Prophet
				sallallahu alehi wasallam would pray the witr prayer near
				dawn time for it is the most blessed time, as mentioned
				previously.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Aisha reports: "Out of the entire night, the Messenger
				of Allah would sometimes perform the witr prayer during
				the early portion; sometimes he would perform it during
				the middle portion; and sometimes in the latter portion
				of the night, just before dawn." This is related by the

			</p>
			<p>
				Nevertheless, considering the possibility of  losing
				witr, the Prophet advised some of his companions not to
				sleep until they had performed the witr prayer in order
				to be on the safe side.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas would pray salatul 'isha in the

				"Yes, for I heard the Messenger of Allah say: 'The one

				It is permissible to perform the witr by praying two
				rak'at [and concluding them] and then praying one rak'ah
				with a tashahud and taslim. Likewise, it is allowed to
				pray all the rak'at with two tashahuds and one taslim.
				One may pray a number of rak'at, one after another,
				without making any tashahud, save in the one before the
				last rak'ah in which case one makes the tashahud and then
				stands to perform the last rak'ah wherein one will make
				another tashahud and end the prayer with the taslim. One
				may also make only one tashahud and the taslim, in the
				last rak'ah of witr. All of that is permissible and can

				Talking about the thirteen rak'at in witr, at-Tirmidhi
				says: "It has been related from the Prophet that he would
				perform the witr prayer with thirteen, nine, seven, five,
				three rak'at or one rak'ah."
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim holds: "The meaning
				of the statement that the Prophet prayed thirteen rak'at
				of witr is that during the night he would pray thirteen
				rak'at including the witr prayer, and so all of the night
				prayer came to be known as witr."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim's view is that "the clear, authentic sunnah
				is to pray the witr with five or seven connected rak'at
				as reported by Umm Salamah in her hadith. [She says] that
				the Prophet would perform the witr with five or seven
				rak'at without breaking them apart with taslim or any
				speech." This is related by Ahmad, an-Nasa'i, and Ibn
				Majah with a good chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				As previously mentioned, al-Bukhari and Muslim quote
				'Aishah saying that the Prophet would perform thirteen
				rak'at during the night and would make the witr prayer
				with five of them, and he would not 'sit' [during those
				five] except in the last rak'ah of them. In another
				hadith, 'Aishah reports that the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam would perform nine rak'at during the night and
				that he would not sit during them until the eighth rak'ah
				in which he would make remembrance of Allah, praising
				Him, and would make supplication. Then, he would stand
				without making the taslim and pray the ninth rak'ah,
				after which he would sit, make the tashahud and make the
				taslim in such a manner that we could hear him. Then, he
				would pray two rak'at after the taslim while sitting, and
				that would make eleven rak'at. When he became older and
				heavier, he would make the witr with seven rak'at,
				performing the (last) two rak'at like the first one. In
				another version from her, it is stated: "When he became
				older and bulkier, he would make the witr with seven
				rak'at, and he would not sit during them, save in the
				sixth and seventh rak'ah and he would not make the
				taslim, save in the seventh rak'ah." In yet another

				All of the preceding ahadith are authentic and clear and
				there is no contradiction in them. As to the Prophet's

				it is not relevant here. This is an authentic hadith, and
				the statement that he observed witr with seven or five
				rak'at is equally true. Both statements confirm each
				other. The seven, five, nine, and one rak'ah constitute
				the witr prayer, for witr is the name given to the one
				rak'ah offered in conclusion of whatever is offered prior
				to it. And the witr of the five, seven and nine rak'at
				are all connected like the maghrib which is described as
				three connected rak'at. If one breaks apart the five or
				seven rak'at with two taslim, like in the eleven rak'at,
				it will all be called witr due to the last odd rak'ah.
				This is supported by the Prophet's statement: 'The night
				prayer is sets of two rak'at. If one fears the coming of
				the dawn, he should perform one rak'ah, thereby making
				all of them odd [witr].' Therefore, the Prophet's actions
				and statements are in agreement, each part confirming the
				other." The fact is that the Prophet was responding to a
				question about the night prayer when he said: "it is in
				pairs of two." He was not speaking about witr, for the
				man had asked him about night prayer, and not about the
				witr.

			<p>
				It is part of sunnah to supplicate with qunut in the witr
				prayer during the entire year. Ahmad, at-Tirmidhi,
				an-Nasa'i, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and others record that
				al-Hassan ibn 'Ali said: "The Messenger of Allah taught
				me the [following] words to say in the witr prayer: 'O

				and nothing is decreed for You. And there is no
				humiliation for whom You take as a ward. Blessed and
				Exalted are You, our Lord. ' "
			</p>
			<p>
				At-Tirmidhi grades this hadith as hasan, and says: "...
				nothing is known from the Prophet concerning qunut more
				authentic than that." Commenting on its status, an-Nawawi
				says that its chain is sahih. Ibn Hazm has some
				reservations about its soundness, but says: "This hadith,
				although it is not one that can be used as a proof, is
				all that we have from the Prophet, and a weak hadith is
				dearer to me than mere opinion." Ahmad says this is also
				the view of Abu Musa, Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn 'Abbas, al-Bara',
				Anas, al-Hassan al-Basri, 'Umar ibn 'Abdul'aziz,
				al-Thauri, Ibn al-Mubarak, and the Hanafi school. This,
				an-Nawawi says, gives credibility to the report.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaf'i and others are of the opinion that the qunut
				in the witr prayer should be made during the latter half
				of the month of Ramadan. This is based on what Abu Dawud
				records that, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab convoked the people in
				prayer, under the leadership of Ubayy ibn Ka'b, and they
				prayed together for twenty nights, and he did not make
				the qunut except for during the latter half of the month
				of Ramadan. It is moreover related that Muhammad ibn Nasr
				asked Sa'id ibn Jubair about the qunut in the witr
				prayer. Sa'id answered: " 'Umar sent an army that
				suffered serious setback, which caused 'Umar to be
				alarmed, so, when it was the latter half of Ramadan, he
				made the qunut to supplicate for them."

				It is permissible to make the qunut before going into

				If one makes the qunut before the ruku', one should make

				It is legitimate to recite the qunut aloud in any of the
				five daily prayers at those times when Muslims are faced
				with calamities. Ibn 'Abbas relates that the Messenger of
				Allah sallallahu alehi wasallam made qunut consecutively
				for one month in the zuhr, 'asr, maghrib, 'isha, and fajr
				prayers. At the end of every prayer, after saying: "Allah
				hears him who praises Him" in the last rak'ah, he would
				supplicate against Re'l, Dhakwan, and 'Usiyyah' of Banu
				Sulaim, and the people behind him would say 'Ameen'. This

				says: "That was the begining of the qunut."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reports that whenever the Prophet sallallahu

				someone, he would make qunut after going into ruku'.
				Sometimes, he would say: "Allah hears him who praises
				Him. Our Lord, to you is the praise. O Allah! Save
				al-Walid ibn al-Walid and Salamah ibn Hisham and 'Iyash
				ibn Abi Rabi'ah and the oppressed [and weak] believers. O
				Allah, put hardship and pressure on the tribe of Mudhar
				and give them years of famine like those during the time
				of Yusuf." He would say this aloud in some of the
				prayers. Also in the dawn prayer, he would say: "Oh

				until Allah revealed: "It is no concern at all of thee

			<p>
				It is not correct to make qunut in the dawn prayer except
				during times of calamity, in which case it may be made in
				any of the five daily prayers. Abu Malik al-Ashja'i said:
				"My father prayed behind the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam when he was sixteen years old, and he prayed
				behind Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthman. I asked him, 'Did
				they make the qunut'?' He said, 'No, son, it is something
				that has been innovated."' This is related by Ahmad,
				an-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and at-Tirmidhi who calls it sahih.
				Anas said that the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam
				would not make the qunut in fajr unless he was
				supplicating for a people or supplicating against a
				people. This is related by Ibn Hibban, al-Khatib, and Ibn
				Khuzaimah who said it is sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also related that az-Zubair, Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and
				'Uthman did not make the qunut in the dawn prayer. This
				is the opinion of the Hanafiyyah, the Hanbaliyyah, Ibn
				al-Mubarak, al-Thauri, and Ishaq. The followers of Shaf'i
				are of the opinion that the qunut is to be made after the
				ruku' of the second rak'ah in the obligatory dawn prayer.
				This opinion is based on the following two reports. Ibn
				Sireen narrates that Anas ibn Malik was asked: "Did the
				Prophet make the qunut in the dawn prayer?" He answered:
				"Yes." They asked him: "Before the ruku' or after it?" He
				replied: "After it." This is related by the group save
				at-Tirmidhi.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a report from Anas which says: "The Messenger of
				Allah sallallahu alehi wasallam did not stop making qunut
				during the dawn prayer until he left this world." This is
				related by Ahmad, al-Bazzar, adDaraqutni, al-Baihaqi, and
				al-Hakim who says it is sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, there remains some doubt concerning this
				evidence since the qunut which they asked Anas about, as
				is clear in the narrations of al Bukhari and Muslim, was
				the qunut during the time of calamities. Concerning the
				latter hadith (the one mentioned in support of their
				stand), in its chain of narrators there is Abu Ja'far
				ar-Razi who is not a credible source and, thus, one
				cannot build a case upon his hadith. How could it be that
				the Messenger of Allah never stopped performing this
				qunut until his death, and yet, the rightly guided
				caliphs did not perform it? It is even confirmed that
				Anas himself did not make the qunut in the dawn prayer!
				If we must accept this latter hadith as authentic, it
				would mean that the Prophet always made supplications and
				remembrance ( dhikr), after the ruku', until his death.
				This would also come under qunut and, in this sense, it
				would be more befitting. Still, this is one of the
				matters in which it is acceptable to have differences of
				opinion, and one may either do it or leave it. The best
				guidance is that of Muhammad sallallahu alehi wasllam.

			<p>
				Its excellence and merit from the Qur'an: Allah ordered
				his Messenger to perform salatul tahajjud:
			</p>
			<p>
				"And some part of the night awake for prayer, a largess
				for thee. It may be that thy Lord will raise thee to a
				praised position."
			</p>
			<p>
				This order, although it was specifically directed to the
				Prophet, also refers to all the Muslims since the Prophet
				is their example and guide in all such matters.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those who regularly perform the tahajjud prayers are the
				Righteous and are more deserving of Allah's bounty and
				mercy. Allah says: "Lo! Those who keep from evil will
				dwell amid gardens and watersprings, taking that which
				their Lord gives them. For, lo, they were doers of good.
				They used to sleep but little of the night and before the
				dawning of each day would seek forgiveness.''
			</p>
			<p>
				Allah praised and complemented the deeds of those who
				perform the late-night prayers. "The slaves of the
				Beneficent are they who walk upon the earth in
				humbleness, and when the ignorant address them, they say:
				'Peace' and they who spend the night prostrating before
				their Lord and standing" [ al-Furqan: 63-64 ].
			</p>
			<p>
				Allah bears witness to their belief in His signs. He
				says: "Only those believe in Our revelations who, when
				they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate and hymn
				the praise of their Lord and they are not scomful: who
				forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and
				hope and spend of what We have bestowed on them. No soul
				knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for
				what they used to do.''
			</p>
			<p>
				Allah proclaims that those who do not possess these
				qualities cannot be treated as equal to those who possess
				them: "Is he who pays adoration in the watches of the
				night, prostrate and standing, aware of the Hereafter and
				hoping for the mercy of his Lord equal to a disbeliever?
				Say: 'Are those who know equal with those who know not?'
				But only men of understanding will pay heed.''

				Upon waking, one should wipe one's face, use a

				which has been reported from the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam: "There is no God but Thee, Glory be to Thee, I
				seek forgiveness from You for my sins, and I ask for your

				truth and Your promise is true. And the meeting with You
				is true.  And the paradise is true. And the Fire is true.

				The number of rak'at to be performed during tahajjud: The
				tahajjud prayer does not entail a specific number of
				rak'at which must be performed nor is there any maximum
				limit which has to be performed. It would be fulfilled
				even if one just prayed one rak'ah of witr after the
				obligatory night prayer.

				Samurah ibn Jundub says: "The Messenger of Allah ordered

				Many hadith describe the excellence of the duha prayer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Dharr reports that the Prophet sallallahu aleihi
				wasallam said: "Charity is required from every part of
				your body daily. Every saying of 'Glory be to Allah' is
				charity. Every saying of 'Praise be to Allah' is charity.
				Every saying of 'There is no God but Allah' is charity.
				Every saying of 'Allah is the Greatest' is charity.
				Ordering the good is charity. Eradicating the evil is
				charity. And what suffices for that (as a charity) are
				the two rak'at of duha." This is related by Ahmad,
				Muslim, and Abu Dawud.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad and Abu Dawud record from Buraidah that the Prophet
				sallallahu alehi wasallam said: "In a human (body) there
				are 360 joints and man must make a charity for each one."
				The people said: "Who can do that, O Messenger of Allah?"
				He responded: "One may cover the mucus that one finds in
				the mosque or remove something harmful from the road. If
				one could not do that, he could pray two rak'at of duha
				and that will be sufficient for him."
			</p>
			<p>
				Talking of the legal import of these hadith, ash-Shaukani
				says: "These two hadith point to the greatness,
				excellence, and importance of the duha prayer, stressing
				its legality as its two rak'at suffice for 360 charities.
				Something like this should be performed regularly and
				persistently. The hadith also establish the importance of
				saying 'Glory be to Allah', 'Praise be to Allah', and
				'There is no God but Allah.' And [the importance of]
				ordering the good, eradicating the evil, removing the
				spittle, removing what is harmful from the path, and such
				other acts that will fulfill what is required of a person
				of daily charities."
			</p>
			<p>
				An-Nawas ibn Sam'an relates that the Prophet sallallahu
				alehi wasallam said: "Allah said: 'Son of Adam, do not

			<p>
				The scholars agree that the prayer of the eclipses is a
				sunnah mu'akkadah, a stressed one, which is to be
				performed by both men and women. It is best to pray it in
				congregation although the congregation is not a condition
				for it. The people are called to it by announcing
				as-salatu jami'ah "prayer in congregation." The majority
				of the scholars hold that it is to consist of two rak'at
				and that in every rak'ah one is to perform two bowings
				(ruku') instead of the customary one.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Aishah narrates: "There was a solar eclipse during the
				time of the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam and the
				Prophet went to the mosque, and he stood and made the
				takbir, and he put the people in rows behind him, and he
				made a lengthy recital during the salah. Next, he made
				the takbir and made a long ruku', but it was not as long
				as the recital. Following that, he raised his head,
				saying: 'Allah hears him who praises Him. And to You, our
				Lord, belongs the praise.' Afterward, he stood and made
				another long recital but it was shorter than the first
				one. Again, he made the takbir and made a ruku' that was
				shorter than the first one. Then, again he said: 'Allah
				hears him who praises Him. And to You, our Lord, belongs
				the praise.' After this, he prostrated. He did the same
				in the next rak'ah and finished four ruku' and four
				sujjud. The sun appeared again before he finished.
				Finally, he stood and addressed the people and praised
				Allah as He deserves it and said: 'The sun and the moon
				are two signs from among Allah's signs and there is no
				eclipse due to someone's death or life. If you see them
				occurring, hurry to pray.'" This is related by alBukhari
				and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bukhari and Muslim also record that Ibn 'Abbas said:
				"There was a solar eclipse during the life time of the
				Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam and he prayed with a
				long standing, similar to what it takes to recite
				alBaqarah. Then, he made a long ruku'. After which, he
				stood and made another long recital but shorter than the
				first one. Again he went into ruku', but for a shorter
				time than in the first one. Following this, he made
				sajdah [twice]. Next he made another long standing
				(qiyam) which was also not as long as the first. After
				that, he made another lengthy ruku' but it was not as
				long as the first one. Again, he made another long qiyam
				[and recital] but it was not as long as the first one.
				After which, he made another lengthy ruku' but it was not
				as long as the previous one. Following this, he went into
				sajdah [and so on]. When he had finished, the sun had
				appeared. He concluded his prayer and said: 'The sun and
				the moon are two signs from the signs of Allah, and there
				is no eclipse due to the death or life of anyone. If you
				see it, make remembrance of Allah.'" Grading these
				reports, Ibn Abdul Barr says: "These two hadith are the
				most authentic reports on this topic."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim observes: "The authentic, clear, and
				prepondering sunnah concerning salatul kasuf is that the
				ruku' is to be repeated [twice] in every rak'ah. This is
				based on the hadith from 'Aishah, Ibn 'Abbas, Jabir,
				Ubayy ibn Ka'b, 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'Aas, and Abu
				Musa alAsh'ari. They all report that the Prophet repeated
				the ruku' in one rak'ah. Those who mention the repeating
				of the ruku' are more in number, weightier, and closer to
				the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam than those who do
				not mention it." This is the opinion of Malik,
				ash-Shaf'i, and Ahmad.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah is of the opinion that salatul Kasuf consists
				of two rak'at, similar to salatul 'id and jumu'ah, based
				on the hadith of An-Nu'man ibn Bashir who says: "The
				Messenger of Allah sallallahu alehi wasallam prayed the
				salatul kasuf with us like one of your prayers. He went
				into ruku' and performed sajdah, praying two rak'at by
				two rak'at, and supplicated to Allah until the sun
				reappeared clearly again."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the hadith from Qabsah al-Hillali, the Prophet said:
				"If you see that [i.e., an eclipse], pray as you pray the
				obligatory prayer." This is related by Ahmad and
				an-Nasa'i.
			</p>
			<p>
				The reciting of al-Fatihah is obligatory in each rak'ah,
				and one may recite whatever one wishes to, after
				Al-Fatihah. It is allowed to make the recital audible or
				silent, but al-Bukhari says: "Audible recital is more
				proper. "

				This prayer is taken recourse to when seeking rain from
				Allah during times of drought. It may be performed in one
				of the following manners:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The imam prays, with the followers, two rak'at
					during any time except those times in which it is
					not desirable to pray. In the first rak'ah, the
					imam recites al-A'1a after al-Fatihah. And in the
					second rak'ah, he reads al-Ghashiyah after
					al-Fatihah, and he delivers a khutbah before or
					after the salah. As soon as he finishes the
					khutbah, the people present should turn their
					outer garments around, each placing its left side
					on his right side and its right side on his left,
					face the qiblah, supplicate Allah and raise their
					hands while doing so.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas reports: "The Messenger of Allah went out [to
				make the salatul istisqa'] wearing old clothes, in a
				humble and lowly manner, and prayed two rak'at as he
				prayed the 'id, but he did not give a similar khutbah."
				This is related by the five. At-Tirmidhi, Abu 'Awanah,
				and Ibn Hibban grade it sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Aishah says: "The people complained to the Messenger of
				Allah about lack of rain, so he gave orders for a pulpit,
				and when it was set up for him, he appointed a day for
				the people to gather. He came out on that day when the
				sun had just appeared and sat down on the pulpit. He
				extolled Allah's greatness and praised Him. Then he said:
				'You have complained of drought in your areas and of
				delay in receiving rain at the beginning of its season,
				but you have been ordered by Allah to supplicate Him and
				He has promised that He would answer your prayers.' Then
				he said: 'All praise is for Allah, the Compassionate, the
				Merciful, the King of the Day of Judgment. There is no
				God but Allah Who does what He wishes. O Allah, there is
				no God except Thee. You are the Self-sufficient and we
				are the poor. Send down rain upon us and make it a source
				of strength for us and satisfaction for us.' He then
				raised his hands and kept raising them till the whiteness
				of his armpits could be seen.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this, he turned his back to the people and inverted
				his cloak, keeping his hands raised. Finally, he faced
				the people, descended from the pulpit, and prayed two
				rak'at. At that time Allah produced a cloud, thunder, and
				lightning. And, by Allah's permission, it rained and
				before he reached the mosque there was flooding. Then he
				saw how quickly the people were running for shelter, he
				laughed until his molar teeth could be seen. He said: 'I
				bear witness that Allah has power over all things and I
				am Allah's slave and Messenger.'" This is related by
				al-Hakim who classifies it to be sahih and by Abu Dawud
				who says: "This hadith is ghareeb and its chain is good."

				It is furthermore related from 'Ibad ibn Tamim from his
				uncle 'Abdullah ibn Zaid al-Mazni that the Prophet
				sallallahu alehi wasallam went out to pray salatul
				istisqa' and prayed two rak'at reciting them aloud. This
				is related by the group. And Abu Hurairah says: "The
				Prophet of Allah went out one day to make salatul
				ishtisqa' and prayed two rak'at with us without any adhan
				or iqamah. Then, he addressed us and supplicated Allah
				and turned his face toward the qiblah, with his hands
				raised. Next, he reversed his cloak, placing its left
				side on his right side and its right side on his left
				side." This is related by Ahmad, Ibn Majah, and

				Al-Bukhari and Muslim record from Shuraik on the
				authority of Anas that a man entered the mosque on Friday
				while the Prophet was addressing the people. The man
				said: "O Messenger of Allah, our wealth has been
				destroyed and we have no transport to the market place.
				Supplicate for us for rain." The Prophet raised his hands
				and said: "O Allah, give us rain. O Allah, give us rain.
				O Allah, give us rain." Anas said: "By Allah, at that
				time there were no clouds in the sky and there was no
				house or building between us and the mountain. From
				behind the mountain came a cloud looking like a shield.
				By the time it reached the middle of the sky, it burst
				and started to rain. By Allah, we did not see the sun for
				one week. Then, on the next Friday, a man entered the
				mosque from that (same) door while the Prophet was making
				the address. The man faced the Prophet and said: 'Our
				livestock is dead and the paths are unpassable. Ask Allah
				to make it stop.' The Prophet raised his hands and said:
				'O Allah, around us and not upon us. O Allah, make it
				upon the hills, small mountains, bottom of the valleys,
				and plantations.' The rain stopped and we walked out in
				the sunshine."
			</p>
			<p>
				Shurahbil ibn as-Simt said to Ka'b ibn Murrah: "O Ka'b,
				relate to us something from the Messenger of Allah." Ka'b
				said: "When a man came and said to the Prophet of Allah,
				'Seek rain for the tribe of Mudhar,' I heard the Prophet
				say: 'You are a bold man. You want me to seek rain for
				the tribe of Mudhar?' The man said: 'O Messenger of
				Allah, you have sought victory from Allah and He gave you
				victory. You supplicated Allah and He answered you.' The
				Messenger of Allah raised his hands and said: 'O Allah,
				give us a saving rain, good and productive, general and
				heavy, now and not later, beneficial and not harmful.'
				Allah responded to his supplication. It was not long
				before the people came complaining about the profusion of
				rain, and damage to their dwellings. The Messenger of
				Allah raised his hands and said: 'O Allah, around us and
				not upon us.' The clouds began dispersing left and
				right." This is related by Ahmad, Ibn Majah, al-Baihaqi,

			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Sha'biy says: "'Umar went out to make ishsqa' and he
				did no more than seeking Allah's forgiveness. The people
				said: 'We did not see you making ishsqa'.' He said: 'I
				sought rain by what makes it descend (i.e., istighfar or
				seeking forgiveness of Allah), unlike those (Arabs of
				days of ignorance) who sought it by the stars of the
				sky.' Then, he recited the following two 'ayat: 'Seek

				will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain.' and:
				'Ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him (in

			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaf'i states that it has been related from Salim ibn
				'Abdullah, on the authority of his father that the
				Prophet would say for ishsqa': "O Allah, give us a saving
				rain, productive, plentiful, general, continuous. O
				Allah, give us rain and do not make us among the
				despondent. O Allah, (Your) slaves, land, animals, and
				(Your) creation all are suffering and seek protection.
				And we do not complain except to You. O Allah, let our
				crops grow, and let the udders be refilled. Give us from
				the blessings of the sky and grow for us from the
				blessings of the earth. O Allah, remove from us the
				hardship, starvation,and barrenness and remove the
				affliction from us as no one removes afflictions save
				Thee. O Allah, we seek Your forgiveness as You are the
				Forgiving, and send upon us plenteous rains." Ash-Shaf'i
				said: "I prefer that the imam would supplicate with that
				(prayer). "
			</p>
			<p>
				Sa'd reported that for ishsqa', the Prophet would
				supplicate: "O Allah, let us be covered with thick clouds
				that have abundant and beneficial rain, frequently making
				a light rain upon us and sprinkling upon us with
				lightning. O Allah, You are full of majesty, bounty and
				Honour." This is related by Abu 'Awanah in his Sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Amr ibn Shuaib relates from his father, on the authority
				of his grandfather, that for istisqa', the Prophet would
				say: "O Allah, provide water for Your slaves and Your
				cattle, display Your mercy and give life to Your dead
				lands." This is related by Abu Dawud.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is preferred for the one who is making this
				supplication to raise his hands with the back of his
				hands toward the sky. Muslim records from Anas that the
				Prophet would point with the back of his hands during
				ishsqa '.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also preferred, upon seeing the rain, to say: "O
				Allah, make it a beneficial rain" and he should uncover
				part of his body to the rain. On the other hand, if one
				fears that there is too much rain, one should say: "O
				Allah give us mercy and do not give us punishment,
				calamaties, destruction or flooding. O Allah, make it
				upon the woods, farms and trees. Make it around us and
				not upon us."
			</p>
			<p>

				takbir again and rise from the prostration. This is
				called "the prostration of recital." There is no tashahud

				of sajdah," and he descended from the pulpit and
				prostrated along with the people. On the next Friday, he

				The majority of the scholars lay down the same conditions
				and prerequisites for the prostration of recital as they
				do for the salah, with respect to purity, facing the
				qiblah, and covering the 'aurah. Ash-Shaukani says:
				"There is no hadith concerning prostrations of recital
				which proves that to prostrate one must be in a state of
				purity [free from major or minor defilements]. The people
				who were with him [the Prophet] prostrated with him and
				he did not order any of them to perform ablution, and it
				is hard to believe that they all were in a state of
				purity. Furthermore, the polytheists prostrated with him
				and they are impure, and their ablution would not be
				acceptable. Al-Bukhari relates from Ibn 'Umar that he
				would prostrate even when not free of minor impurities.
				Ibn Abi Shaibah recorded the same from him. As for the
				report from al-Baihaqi, (with a chain that Ibn Hajar
				calls sahih), which says: 'A man is not to prostrate
				unless he is in a state of purity.' These reports can be
				reconciliated by Ibn Hajar's statement that this (either)
				refers to a major defilement or when an option is
				available, whereas in the first case it depends on
				(presence of defilement and) the need to wash. Similarly,
				there is no hadith which states that the clothes or place
				need to be pure. Concerning covering the 'aurah and
				facing the qiblah if possible, there is no disagreement.

			<p>
				Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari: "No one agrees with Ibn
				'Umar that one may make the sajdah without being clean of
				minor impurities, save ashSha'biy. Ibn Abi Shaibah
				related it from him with a sahih chain. He also recorded
				from Abu 'Abdurrahman as-Salmi that he would recite an
				'ayyah of sajdah and then he would prostrate without
				ablution or facing the qiblah and while walking and just
				motioning only. Some among the Prophet's household agree

				The "prostrations of forgetfulness" (sujjud us-sahu) are
				two prostrations which a person makes before the taslim.
				All of this has been confirmed from the Prophet
				sallallahu alehi wasallam. In the sahih, it is recorded
				from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Prophet said: "If one
				of you has some doubts during his salah and he does not
				recall (the number of rak'at) he has prayed, three or
				four, then he can put an end to his doubt by performing
				salah according to what he was certain of [the lesser
				amount] and then making two sujjud before the taslim." In
				the story of Dhul-Yadain, in the two Sahihs, we are told
				the Prophet sallallahu alehi wassalam made the
				prostrations after the taslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaukani says: "The best that is stated on this
				subject is that one must follow what the Prophet said or
				did, respecting the sujjud before or after the taslim. If
				one does something that necessitates sujjud before the
				taslim, one should make them before the taslim, and if
				one does something requiring sujjud after the taslim,
				then one should make them after the taslim. As for those
				acts of forgetfulness that are not related to any
				specific time either before or after the taslim, one may
				choose to make the prostrations before or after the
				taslim in cases of addition or reduction in the salah.
				This is based on what Muslim recorded in his Sahih from
				Ibn Mas'ud that the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam
				said: 'If one adds or decreases something from his salah,
				he should make two sujjud."'

				The "sujjud us-sahu" are to be performed in the following
				circumstances:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If a person makes the taslim before he actually
					completes the prayers. Ibn Sireen relates from
					Abu Hurairah who said: "The Prophet sallallahu
					alehi wasallam prayed either zuhr or 'asr salah
					with us and he prayed only two rak'at and made
					the taslim. He got up and leaned against a piece
					of wood in the mosque as if he was angry. He put
					his right hand on his left and interlocked his
					fingers. Then, he placed his cheek on the back of
					his left hand. And some people left the mosque in
					a hurry. And they said: 'The prayer has been
					shortened?' Among the people were Abu Bakr and
					'Umar, and they were shy to speak to him. One of
					the people, who was called Dhul-Yadain, said: 'O
					Messenger of Allah have you forgotten or has the
					prayer been shortened?' He answered: 'I have not
					forgotten and it has not been shortened.' Then he
					asked: 'Is it as Dhul-Yadain has said?' The
					people answered in the affirmative...At that, he
					led the people in what he had ommitted and made
					the taslim. After which he made the takbir and
					prostrated the way he usually prostrated or
					perhaps even longer. Next, he raised his head and
					made the takbir. Then, he made the takbir [again]
					and prostrated, like one of his customary sujjud
					or perhaps even longer, and finally, he raised
					his head." This is related by al-Bukhari and
					Muslim.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				'Ata' relates that Ibn az-Zubair prayed maghrib and made
				the taslim after two rak'at and then he stood up and
				wanted to kiss the black stone, when the people tried to
				correct him he said: "What is the matter with you?" Then
				he prayed what he had left out and performed two sujjud.
				When this was mentioned to Ibn 'Abbas, he said that it
				was not far from the sunnah of the Prophet sallallahu
				alehi wasallam. This is related by Ahmad, al-Bazzar, and
				at-Tabarani.
			</p>
			<p>
				In one narration, it is stated: "Whoever prays and has
				some doubt that he was short of the complete prayer, he
				should continue praying until he suspects that he has
				added something to the prayer [with respect to the number
				of rak'at that he has prayed]." Abu Sa'id al-Khudri
				narrated that the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam said:
				"If one of you has some doubts during his prayer and does
				not know if he prayed three or four [rak'at], then he
				should remove his doubt by praying according to the
				amount that he is certain he had performed and then make
				two sujjud before the taslim. If he had prayed five
				rak'at, the two sujjud would make it even. If he had
				prayed a complete four rak'at [when he had finished],
				they would be in defiance of the Satan." This is related
				by Ahmad and Muslim. These two ahadith prove what the
				majority of the scholars have said, namely, if one has
				some doubt concerning the number of rak'at one has
				prayed, one should act according to the amount that one
				is certain to have prayed (the lesser amount) and then
				make two sujjud before the taslim.

				Performing the prayers in congregation is a sunnah

			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar reports that the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam said: "Prayer in congregation is superior to a
				prayer performed individually by twenty-seven degrees."
				This is related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reports that the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam said: "The prayer of a man in congregation is
				twenty-five times more superior (in reward) to his prayer
				in his house or market - and this is because he makes the
				wudu' and perfects it and goes to the mosque with the
				sole purpose of performing the salah. He does not take a
				step without being raised a degree and having one of his
				sins erased. When he prays, as long as he does not lose
				his wudu, the angels keep on praying [for him] 'O Allah,
				bless him. O Allah, have mercy on him.' And he is
				considered in salah as long as he is waiting for the
				salah." This is related by al-Bukhari and Muslim, and it
				is presented in al-Bukhari's wording.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah also reports that a blind man said to the
				Prophet: "O Messenger of Allah, I have no guide to guide
				me to the mosque." He asked the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam for permission to pray in his house and the
				Prophet gave it to him. Then, when he turned to go, the
				Prophet called him and said: "Do you hear the call to
				prayer?" The blind man said "yes." The Prophet then said:
				"Then respond to it!" [by coming to the mosque.] This is
				related by Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah also reports that the Prophet sallallahu
				alehi wasallam said: "By Him in whose hand is my soul! I
				have considered ordering a fire to be kindled and then
				ask someone to lead the people in salah. And then go to
				the men [who did not attend the prayer] and burn their
				houses over them." This is related by al-Bukhari and
				Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud says: "If anyone would like to meet
				Allah tomorrow as a Muslim, he should persevere in
				abserving these five prayers whenever the call for them
				is made, for Allah has chosen for your Prophet the way of
				right guidance. And the [five prayers in congregation]
				are part of this right guidance. If you were to pray them
				in your houses, as this man who stays behind in his
				house, you would be leaving a sunnah of your Prophet. If
				you leave the sunnah of your Prophet, you would go
				astray. Verily, I have seen a time when no one stayed
				away from them [the congregational prayers] except for
				the hypocrites who were well known for their hypocrisy. A
				man would be brought, supported by two people [due to his
				weakness] until he was placed in a row." This is related

				Abu ad-Darda' reports that the Messenger of Allah

				them, then the Satan takes mastery over them. So be with
				the congregation since the wolf devours the remote

				'Will you lead the people in salah and I shall make the

				rows. The people clapped [their thighs with their hands]
				but Abu Bakr would not turn around during the prayer.
				When most of the people began clapping, he turned and saw
				the Prophet...[who] pointed to Abu Bakr to stay in his
				place. Abu Bakr raised his hands and praised Allah
				because of what the Prophet had told him. Then, Abu Bakr
				moved back until he joined the rows and the Prophet
				stepped forward [to lead]. After he had prayed, he went
				to Abu Bakr and said: O Abu Bakr, what prevented you from
				staying there when I told you to do so?' Abu Bakr said:
				'It is not fit for the son of Abu Quhafah to lead the
				Prophet in prayer.' Then the Messenger of Allah said:
				'Why did I see most of you clapping? If you find
				something in the prayer you should say subhanallah, for
				when you say it, it will attract his (i.e. imam's)
				attention and clapping [thighs with hands] is for the

			<p>
				Many hadith have been related which warn against leading
				a congregation while one is disliked by them. Dislike
				here relates to one's religious conduct and is based on a
				valid reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas relates that the Prophet said: "Three people's
				prayers will not rise above their head the length of a
				hand's span. [They are:] a man who leads a people in
				salah and they do not like him, a woman who has disobeyed
				her husband and he is dipleased with her, and two
				brothers who are estranged." This is related by Ibn
				Majah. Al-'lraqi says its chain is hasan.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Abdullah ibn 'Amr relates that the Prophet sallallahu
				alehi wasallam said: "Allah does not accept prayers from
				three [types of] people: a man who leads a people and
				they dislike him, a man who attends the prayers after
				their time is finished, and a man who re-enslaves his
				freed slave." This is related by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Elaborating upon it, at-Tirmidhi says: "It is disliked
				that a man should lead a people in salah while they
				dislike him. If the imam is not a wrongdoer, then the sin
				is upon those who don't like him."

		<section heading="The Positioning Of The Imam And The Followers">
			<p>
				It is preferred for one person to stand to the right of
				the imam and for a "group of two (or more)" to stand
				behind the imam.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jabir reports: "The Prophet stood to pray and I came and
				stood on his left. He took me by my hand [and led me]
				around him until I stood on his right. Then, Jabir ibn
				Sakhr came and stood on the left of the Messenger of
				Allah sallallahu alehi wasallam. He took both of us by
				our hands and pushed us back until we stood behind him."
				This is related by Muslim and Abu Dawud.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a woman is present with the group, then she is to
				stand in a row by herself behind the men and she is not
				to join them in their rows. If she did not stand in a
				separate row, her salah will still be valid according to
				the opinion of majority. Anas said: "An orphan and I
				prayed behind the Messenger of Allah in our house and my
				mother prayed behind us." In another version it is
				stated: "He put me and the orphan in a row behind him and
				the woman behind us." This is related by al-Bukhari and
				Muslim.

				It is preferred for the imam to stand in the center of

				people of intellect and understanding.

			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reports that the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam said: "Let the imam stand in the center, and
				close the gaps in the rows." This is related by Abu Dawud
				and both he and al-Mundhiri make no further comment on
				its authenticity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Mas'ud reports that the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam said: "Let those who are prudent and sedate be
				near me, then those who are next to them, then those who
				are next to them, and beware of the tumult of the market
				place." This is related by Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Dawud, and
				at-Tirmidhi.

			<p>
				Anas said: "The Prophet loved that the emigrants
				(muhajarin) and helpers (ansar) stand next to him so that
				they would learn from him." This is related by Ahmad and
				Abu Dawud. The wisdom behind having such people close to
				the imam is that they can correct him if he makes a

				If a person makes his opening takbir behind a row and

			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Bakra reports that he came to the salah while the
				Prophet was performing ruku' and Abu Bakra performed the
				ruku before he entered the row. He mentioned this to the
				Prophet and he said: "May Allah increase your love for
				goodness, but do not repeat that act." This is related by
				Ahmad, al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, and anNasa'i.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the majority, If a person prays behind the
				rows by himself, his salah will be valid but diliked.
				Ahmad, Ishaq, Ahmad, ibn Abu Laila, Waki', al-Hassan ibn
				Saleh, an-Nakha'i and Ibn al-Mundhir hold that if a
				person prays one complete rak'ah behind the rows, his
				salah will be invalid.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wabsah relates that the Messenger of Allah saw a man
				praying behind the rows by himself and the Propeht
				ordered him to repeat his salah. This is related by the
				five save an-Nasa'i. In Ahmad's version, the Messenger of
				Allah was asked about a man who prays by himself behind
				the rows and he said: "He is to repeat his salah."
				At-Tirmidhi called this hadith hasan and Ahmad's chain is
				good.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Ali ibn Shaiban relates that the Messenger of Allah saw
				a man praying behind the row and he waited for him and
				(when he finished) told him: "Go forward (and join the
				row) for the salah of a person standing alone behind the
				rows is not valid." This is related by Ahmad, Ibn Majah,
				and al-Baihaqi. Ahmad says it is hasan. Ibn Sayyid
				an-Nass said its narrators are well-known, trustworthy
				people.
			</p>
			<p>
				The majority stick to the hadith of Abu Bakra who said
				that he preformed part of the prayer, behind the row, and
				the Prophet did not order him to repeat his salah.
				Repeating the salah signifies overzeal in practicing what
				is recommended and better.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Kaman ibn al-Hamam said: "Our scholars are of the
				opinion that the hadith of Wabsah refers to what is
				preferred while the hadith of 'Ali ibn ash-Shaiban
				underlines failure to practice what is the best and, as
				such, they are in harmony with the hadith of Abu Bakra.
				It is clear, then, that it is not necessary to repeat the
				salah because such an act was not always ordered.
			</p>
			<p>
				If someone comes to the row and does not find sufficient
				space or a gap to stand in the row, then, according to
				some, he should stand by himself and it is disliked that
				he should pull anyone back from the row. Others say that
				he should pull one, who is aware of the ruling, back from

				Anas relates: "The Prophet would turn his face to us
				before he began the salah and he would say: 'Be close

				Jabir ibn Samrah says: "The Prophet sallallahu alehi

				Prophet insisted that Abu Bakr lead the salah after he
				was inforrned that he would be overcome by weeping proves
				that it is permissible to cry while praying.

				'Umar prayed fajr and recited Surah Yusuf, and when he
				reached the verse "I expose my distress and anguish only
				unto Allah," he raised his voice in crying. This is
				related by al-Bukhari, Sa'id ibn Mansur, and ibn
				al-Mundhir. In 'Umar's raising his voice in crying is a
				refutation of those who say that crying invalidates the
				salah if it causes a sound from the mouth, regardless of
				whether it is due to the fear of Allah or not. They argue
				that sound from the mouth due to crying is like speaking,
				but this is not acceptable as  crying and speaking are
				two different things.

				Abu Qatadah reports that the Prophet sallallahu alehi

				down, and when he got up from his sajdah, he would place

				Zaid ibn Abu 'Atab from 'Amr ibn Salim that this happened
				in the morning prayer. This is related by Ahmad,
				anNasa'i, and others. Al-Fakihani comments: "The purpose
				behind the action of the Prophet of carrying Umamah in
				the salah was to set an example before the Arabs who
				considered having daughters and carrying them around as
				something bad or shameful. The Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam acted differently from them, and carried a girl
				on his neck in the prayer, and making something clear by
				example is much more effective than a mere precept."

				'Abdullah ibn Shidad relates that his father said: "The

				The Prophet proceeded to the front and put him down and

				a long sajdah. I raised my head and saw the child on the

				returned to my sajdah. When the Messenger of Allah
				finished the salah, the people said to him: 'O Messenger
				of Allah, you prostrated during your salah so long that
				we suspected you were thinking about some matter or you
				were receiving some revelation.' He said: 'None of that
				happened but my son was resting and I hated to rush him
				until he had finished what he desired."' This is related
				by Ahmad, an-Nasa'i, and al-Hakim.
			</p>
			<p>
				An-Nawawi observes that this, according to the opinion of
				ash-Shaf'i and those who agree with him, points to the
				permissibility of carrying or holding a young child, male
				or female, or any pure animal during an obligatory
				prayer, and that it is permissible for both the imam and
				the followers. The companions of Malik say that the
				permissibility is only for voluntary prayers and not for
				obligatory prayers. This interpretation is incorrect as
				it is clear that the Prophet was leading one of the
				obligatory prayers, and as stated earlier it was the fajr
				prayer. Some followers of Malik claim that its
				permissibility has been abograted, while others say it
				was only permissible for the Prophet, and yet others hold
				that it was due to some necessity. All of this is wrong
				and to be rejected as there is no proof for any of it or
				any necessity. The authentic hadith clearly states that
				it is permissible and there is nothing in that ruling
				which contradicts any basic principle of the shari'ah as
				a human being is pure and what is in his/her abdomen is
				not relevant in this regard, as it remains within the
				stomach, its natural receptacle. Also, the clothing of a
				child is considered pure and the shari'ah is quite
				explicit on this point. Actions during the salah do not
				invalidate it if they are minor or few or dispersed. The
				fact that the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam did this
				is an exposition of its permissibility, and this argument
				is built upon the principle which we have mentioned
				before. This refutes what Abu Sulaiman al-Khattabi says,
				namely, that the Prophet did not carry the child
				intentionally but the child was holding onto the Prophet,
				and when he stood the child remained with him. He said:
				"Do not think that he held him again intentionally as
				that would be too much action and would distract the
				heart. If a curtain distracted him, how could [the child]
				not distract him?" This statement by al-Khattabi, may
				Allah have mercy on him, is incorrect and to be rejected.
				Among the things that refute it are the statements in
				Sahih Muslim, "when he stood, he carried him." And, "when
				he got up from his sajdah, he would return [the child to
				his place]." Further refutations are derived from a
				version other than Sahih Muslim, "He came to us while
				carrying Umamah and prayed..." Concerning the ruling
				about the curtain, it distracts the heart without there
				being any benefit to it. Concerning carrying Umamah, we
				are not convinced that it distracts the heart, and even
				if it does, it is allowed due to its benefit and the
				principles that we have mentioned. The source of that
				preoccupation is that benefit, which differs from the
				incident concerning the curtain. Thus, the correct
				position is that the hadith is a clear exposition that it
				is permissible to carry a child in salah and this will
				continue to be part of the Islamic law until the Day of
				Judgment. And Allah knows best.

		<section heading="A summary of other acts which are permissible during the prayer">
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim has summarized some of the acts which are
				permissible during the salah and which the Prophet
				sallallahu alehi wasallam used to perform at times. He
				writes:
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet would pray and 'Aishah would be lying between
				him and the qiblah. When he performed sajdah, he would
				signal to her with his hand and she would pull back her
				leg and when he would stand she would stretch out her leg
				again. The Prophet was praying and the Satan came to him
				to disturb his salah and the Prophet choked until his
				saliva came upon his hand. And the Prophet would pray
				upon the pulpit, making ruku' there, but when the time
				came to perform sajdah, he would descend, moving
				backward, and prostrate upon the ground, and then return
				to the pulpit. He once prayed toward a wall and an animal
				tried to pass between him and the wall. The Prophet
				prevented the animal from passing to the extent that its
				stomach was against the wall. Once while he was praying,
				two girls from the tribe of 'Abd al-Muttalib were
				fighting behind him and he separated them with his arms
				while he was praying. Ahmad's version says that they
				grabbed unto his knees and he separated them without
				leaving the salah. On another occasion, when he was
				praying, a boy came to him and he motioned to him to move
				back, and he moved back. Then a girl tried to pass in
				front of him, he beckoned her to move back, but the girl
				passed, and when he finished, he said: "They are more
				determined." Ahmad recorded it and it is also in the
				Sunan. He would also puff out air while praying. The
				hadith which states: " Puffing out is speech" cannot be
				traced to the Messenger of Allah, but Sa'id related it in
				his Sunan from Ibn 'Abbas as one of Ibn 'Abbas'
				statements - if it is authentic. The Prophet would cry
				during his salah and would also clear his throat while
				praying. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib said: "I had a certain time
				at which I would visit the Messenger of Allah. When I
				came to him, he would permit me to enter. If I found him
				praying, he would clear his throat and I would enter. If
				he was free, he would give me permission to enter." This
				is recorded by an-Nasa'i and Ahmad. Ahmad's version says:
				"I could enter upon the Prophet during the day or night.
				If I came to him while he was praying, he would clear his
				throat [as a sign that I may enter]. This was related by
				Ahmad who used to act by it and he was not of the opinion
				that clearing one's throat invalidated the salah.
				Sometimes the Prophet would pray barefoot and sometimes
				while wearing shoes. This is what 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar
				said and he ordered people to pray with shoes on in order
				to differ from the Jews. Sometimes he would pray in one
				garment and sometimes in two garments and [this latter]
				was the majority of the cases.

				This is reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Bukhari also records that 'Umar said: "I arrange the

				"That Satan is called Khanzab. If he affects you seek

				three times."
			</p>
			<p>
				Muslim records from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of

				and My slave, and my slave shall receive what he asks

				Talking [if it is a reminder as to the incompleteness of

				He said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah, you did forget.'

				correct in what he says?' The people said: 'He is
				correct, you offered only two rak'at.' Then, the Prophet
				prayed the two remaining rak'at and made the taslim, said
				the takbir and performed the sajdah, sat and made the

				The Maliki school allows talking during the prayer if it

				An-Nawawi says: "If a person performs a lot of actions

				and, on this point, there is no difference of opinion. If

				and, on this point, there also is no difference of

				exist a difference of opinion over what exactly

				exist four opinions on this point..." He says that the
				fourth opinion is the correct and most popular opinion.
				The fourth opinion is that the exact definitions of too
				much and too little are determined by generally accepted
				standards. One is not harmed in his salah by common acts
				such as nodding in reply to a salutation, taking off
				one's shoes, raising the headdress and putting it back in
				place, putting on or taking off a light garment, carrying
				or holding a small child, preventing someone from passing
				in front of the person in prayer, covering one's spittle
				in one's clothing and similar other actions. As for the
				other acts, those which are considered to constitute many
				actions (e.g., taking many consecutive steps, performing
				actions repeatedly) they invalidate the prayer. An-Nawawi
				also says: "The scholars are in agreement that many
				actions invalidate the prayer if they are performed
				consecutively [i.e., one after another]. If one separates
				the actions, for instance, taking a step and then
				stopping for a while, then taking another step or two,
				and then another two steps, after a pause (though a short
				one) between them, then the salah will not be harmed,
				even if he (in this manner should take a hundred or more
				steps. There is no difference of opinion on this point.
				As for light actions," he continues, "such as, moving
				one's finger in glorifying Allah or in itching, and so
				forth., these do not invalidate the prayer according to
				the well-known, authentic opinion, even when they are
				done repeatedly and consecutively, but they are
				disliked." AshShaf'i, in a statement concerning it, says:
				"Even if one counts the verses on one's fingers, it would
				not invalidate one's salah, but it is best to avoid [such

				He may however, resort to increasing his voluntary and
				supererogatory acts. Ibn Hazm has thoroughly discussed
				this question. The following is a summary of what he says
				on this subject:
			</p>
			<p>
				Concerning one who leaves a salah intentionally until its
				time expires, he will never be able to make up for that
				salah. Such a person should turn to Allah and ask His
				forgivness and increase his good deeds and nawafil in
				order to increase his weight [of good] on the Day of
				Resurrection. Abu Hanifah, Malik, and ash-Shaf'i say that
				he can make up the prayer after its time has expired, and
				Malik and Abu Hanifa even say that if a person
				intentionally misses a prayer or a few prayers, then he
				is to make up those prayers before he prays the present
				salah, even if he has missed all five prayers and should,
				while making them up, miss the present salah. They say
				that if he missed more than five prayers, he is to begin
				by praying the salah whose time is present [and then he
				is to make up the prayers he missed]. The proof for our
				position [i.e, the position of Ibn Hazm] is found in the
				words of Allah, the Exalted: "Woe unto the worshippers
				who are heedless of their prayers,'' and: "And then there
				succeeded them a later generation who wasted the prayers
				and followed their own lusts, but they will meet with
				destruction." If one who intentionally misses a salah
				could make it up later, then why is it mentioned with
				affliction or transgression? Of course, there is no
				affliction or transgression on one who delays the salah.
				But the case of one who procrastinates until the last
				portion of its permissible time expires is quite
				different. Allah, the Exalted, has appointed certain
				times for the fard salah; both the beginning time and the
				ending time for the salah have been established, and
				there is no difference between praying a salah before its
				time and praying it after its proper time elapses
				because, in both cases the salah is not performed within
				its prescribed time. This is not to draw an analogy
				between one and the other but it is applying the same
				rule to them as they both must be performed within the
				limits set by Allah. Allah, the Exalted, says: "Whoever
				transgresses the limits set by Allah has verily wronged
				his own soul!" 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="The principle of making qada' must be established by the proper sources of Islamic law. Legislating [in shari'ah] is not permissible, save by Allah's authority as evidenced by His Prophet. We ask those people who say that one may make qada' for a salah which he misses intentionally: 'Tell us about this salah that you want him to perfom, is it the same salah that Allah ordered him to perform or is it a different one?' If they say it is the same one, then we may say to them: 'Then one who misses it intentionally is not guilty of being disobedient [to Allah, the Exalted], as he has done what Allah had ordered him to do, and there is no sin upon him according to your statement and likewise there should be no blame upon one who intentionally delays a salah until its time expires, but that is not an acceptable position for any Muslim.' If they say that it is not the salah which Allah ordered, we may say: 'You have told the truth,' and this is a sufficient confession from them. Then, we may ask them: 'Is one who intentionally leaves the salah until its time expires being obedient or disobedient to Allah?' If they say obedient, they will be differing from the consensus of the Muslims and the Qur'an and the confirmed sunnah. If they say he is being disobedient, they are speaking the truth and it is not valid that an act of disobedience should replace an act of obedience. Also, Allah, the Exalted, has set specific limits, through the tongue of His Messenger, for the times of the salah. Each salah has a specific beginning time, and no one may perform the salah before that time, and each prayer has a specific ending time, and no one may perform the salah after that time. No one of this ummah will dispute that point. However, if one is allowed to pray after the time set by the Messenger of Allah, then setting an ending time for the salah has no meaning to it. Such an opinion is nonsense and may Allah, the Exalted, keep us from it. Every action is connected with a certain time and it is not valid outside of that time; if it was valid outside of that time, what would be the purpose of that time being specifically singled out for that act? [The logic of this argument] is clear and Allah, the Almighty, is our Supporter.">
			<p>
				Ibn Hazm discusses this point at great length, and adds:
				"If making up a salah is obligatory for one who has left
				a salah, even after its time has expired, why is it that
				Allah and His Messenger have chosen not to mention that
				fact as (surely) they did not forget it: "And your Lord
				is not forgetful!" Any law that is not based on the
				Qur'an or the sunnah is not valid. It has been
				authentically reported that the Prophet said: "Whoever
				misses the 'asr salah, it is as if he has lost his family
				and his property." It is correct to say that if one
				"misses" something, he cannot make it up, for if he makes
				it up or could make it up, the act would not be "missed."
				The entire Muslim ummah is in agreement with the
				statement and ruling that if the time of the salah has
				elapsed, then the salah is "over" [i.e., "qada" in
				Arabic], but if one can make it up, the statement that
				the salah is "over" becomes false and untrue; therefore,
				there is no way that it could ever be made up. The people
				who agree with us on this include 'Umar ibn al-Khattab,
				his son 'Abdullah, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqas, Salman al-Farsi,
				ibn Mas'ud, al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Budail
				al-'Uqaili, Muhammad ibn Sireen, Mutraf ibn 'Abdullah,
				'Umar ibn 'Abdulaziz, and others. Allah has left no
				excuse, for anyone required to perform the salah, to
				delay the salah from its proper time for any reason
				whatsoever, not even during times of fighting, fear,
				extreme illness, or travelling. Allah says: "And when you
				are among them and arrange them for salah, let only one
				party be with you" And: "But if you are in danger, then
				walking or riding." Allah, the Exalted, does not permit
				even the extremely sick person to delay the salah. In
				fact, such a person has been ordered to pray sitting, if
				he cannot pray standing, and if he cannot pray sitting,
				then he may pray on his side. Also, if one cannot make
				ablution with water, he may make tayammum; and if he
				cannot find soil to make tayammum, he may still pray.
				Whence has the permission been obtained that one may
				intentionally leave the salah until its time is finished
				and who has ordered that it be performed after its time
				and how is it that the belated salah would be sufficient?
				None of this is derived from the Qur'an, Sunnah, Qiyas
				(analogical reasoning), and so forth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Hazm further says: "Concerning our statement that the
				one who intentionally leaves a salah until its time
				expires is to repent to Allah, the Exalted, ask for His
				forgiveness, pray an increased number of nawafil, and do
				good deeds. This statement is based on Allah's words:
				"Then there succeeded them a generation who missed
				prayers and followed after lusts. But they will meet
				destruction save him who repents and believes and does
				right. Such will enter the garden and will not be
				wronged," and: "...those who, when they do an evil thing
				or wrong themselves, remember Allah and implore
				forgiveness for their sins - who forgives sins, save
				Allah - and will not knowingly repeat the wrong they
				did," and: "Whoever does an atom's weight of good shall
				see it and whoever does an atom's weight of evil shall
				see it," and: "...We set a just balance for the day of
				resurrection so no soul shall be wronged."
			</p>
			<p>
				This [Muslim] ummah is in agreement, and there are texts
				that state that voluntary acts are a type of good deeds
				and Allah knows how much they are really worth. It
				necessarily follows that a number of voluntary works may
				be equivalent in merit to an obligatory deed and may even
				amount to a greater merit. Furthermore, Allah has
				informed us that He does not waste the action of any
				person and that the good deeds erase the evil ones.

				If he cannot do so, he should pray sitting. If he is not
				able to make the sajdah, he should nod with his head and
				make the nod of his sajjud lower than that of his ruku'.
				If he cannot pray in a sitting posture, he should pray
				while lying down on his right side facing the qiblah. If
				one cannot pray on his right side, he should pray while
				lying on his back with his legs stretched out toward the
				qiblah." This is related by ad-Daraqutni. Some scholars
				maintain that one can pray in whatever manner is easy for
				him. It is apparent from the hadith that if one can only
				nod while lying on his back, then nothing else is
				obligatory upon him.

				The scholars are all in agreement about the legality of
				"fear prayer" (salatul Khauf). The Qur'an says: "When You
				(O Prophet) are with them, and stand to lead them in
				prayer, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with
				you, taking their arms with them. When they finish
				prostrations, let them take their position in the rear.
				And let the other party come up which has not yet prayed
				- and let them pray with you, taking all precautions, and
				bearing arms: the unbelievers wish if you were negligent
				of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single
				rush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your
				arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you
				are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For
				the unbelievers Allah has prepared humiliating
				punishment."
			</p>
			<p>
				On this subject Imam Ahmad says: "There are six or seven
				confirmed hadith about 'salatul khauf,' and whichever way
				one performs it, it will be valid."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim says: "Basically, there are six ways to
				pray salatal khauf, although some say there are more than
				(six ways of praying it). Whenever they notice any
				difference in the narration of an incident, they describe
				it as a difference [in the manner of prayer] thus coming
				to seventeen ways. This might be due to different acts of
				the Prophet or simply to differences in the narrations."

				Saleh ibn Khawat relates from Saleh ibn Abu Khaithimah
				that a group lined up with the Prophet sallallahu alehi

				after the imam made the taslim without discontinuing
				their salah (i.e., for them, it was two continuous
				rak'at), and the first group did not complete their salah
				until the second group had completed their salah and went

				raised our heads from the ruku'. Next he went down for
				sajdah as well as the row closest to him, while the back
				row stood facing the enemy until the Prophet and the
				first row had completed their prostrations, after which
				the back row made sajdah and then stood [after completing

				moved to the front while those in the front row moved to

				prostrated with him while the [new] back row stood facing

				completed their sujjud, the [new] back row made the

				If one is attacking the enemy and fears that he will miss

			</p>
			<p>
				The issue was also referred to 'Aishah and she said: "The
				salah was made fard in Makkah in sets of two rak'at. When
				the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam came to Medinah,
				two rak'at were added to each salah except the maghrib
				salah because it is the witr of the daytime, and the dawn

			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim says: "The Prophet would pray only two

				'Umar, 'Ali, Ibn Mas'ud, ibn 'Abbas, ibn 'Umar, Jabir and

			<p>
				The conclusion from the Qur'anic verse is that any
				traveling, be it long or short, which falls within the
				linguistic definition of the word "travel" would suffice
				to shorten one's salah, to combine them and to break the
				fast. There is nothing in the sunnah which confines this
				general term to any particular meaning. Ibn al-Mundhir
				and others have mentioned more than twenty reports on
				this point. Here we shall mention some of the more
				important reports.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Dawud, and al-Baihaqi record that
				Yahya ibn Yazid said: "I asked Anas ibn Malik about
				shortening the prayer, and he said: 'The Messenger of
				Allah would pray two rak'at if he had traveled a distance
				of three miles or farsakh."' Ibn Hajar writes in Fath
				al-Bari: "This is the most authentic hadith which states
				and clarifies [that question]." The conflict between mile
				and farsakh is made clear in Abu Sa'id al-Khudri's
				statement: "If the Prophet traveled a distance of one
				farsakh, he would shorten his prayer." This was related
				by Sa'id ibn Mansur in his Sunan and by al-Hafiz ibn
				Hajar in at-Talkhis, and he implicitly accepted it by not
				making any further comments about it. It is well-known
				that a farsakh equals three miles and, therefore, Abu
				Sa'id's hadith removes the confusion which arises from
				Anas' hadith when he says that the shortest distance, due
				to which the Prophet shortened his prayer, was three
				miles. One farsakh is equivalent to 5,541 meters while
				one mile equals 1,748 meters. The shortest distance which
				has been mentioned with respect to the shortening of
				salah is one mile. This was recorded by Ibn abi Shaibah,
				with a sahih chain, on the authority of Ibn 'Umar. Ibn
				Hazm follows this report, and argues that if the distance
				is less than one mile, one is not to shorten the salah,
				the Messenger of Allah went to the graveyard of al-Baqi'
				to bury the dead and (similarly) he went off to answer
				the call of nature and did not shorten his salah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Concerning what some jurists say, namely, that the
				journey must be at least two days long or as some say
				three days, Imam Abu al-Qasim alKharqi's refutation of
				their opinion is sufficient for us. In al-Mughni he says:
				 'I do not find any proof for what those scholars say.
				The statements of the (sahabah) companions are
				contradictory, and they are not a (conclusive) proof if
				they differ. Something has been related from Ibn 'Umar
				and Ibn 'Abbas which differs from what these scholars use
				as proof. Even if that were not the case, their
				statements do not constitute a proof when a statement or
				action of the Prophet himself exists. Even if their
				statements were accepted, we would not be able to follow
				the distance they mentioned due to the following two
				reasons. One, they differ from the sunnah that has been
				related from the Prophet and from the clear meaning of
				the Qur'an, as the clear meaning of the verse allows one
				to shorten one's salah if one makes any journey upon the
				earth. Allah says: "If you journey on the earth, there is
				no blame upon you if you shorten your prayer." The
				condition of there being fear has been deleted as can be
				seen in the hadith we recorded from Ya'la ibn Umayyah,
				and what remains is the clear meaning of the verse which
				covers every type of journey. The Prophet said: "The
				traveler may wipe over his socks for a period of three
				days." This shows the length of time that one may wipe
				over the socks and it cannot be used as a proof for the
				question we are discussing here. One could argue that
				traveling is less than a three-day journey on the basis
				of the hadith: "It is not allowed for any woman who
				believes in Allah and the last day to travel a journey of
				one day, save in the presence of a male relative." Two,
				the question of the distance to be traveled is one that
				may only be answered by some sort of revelation from
				Allah, the Exalted [the Qur' an or Sunnah]; it is not the
				type of issue which one may address on the basis of
				personal reasoning, nor is there any way to derive an
				analogy. The proofs which exist support the opinion that
				shortening the salah is permissible for every traveler,
				unless there is some consensus to the contrary."
			</p>
			<p>
				Similar to that is the traveling by planes, trains, and
				so forth, or a trip that is in obedience to Allah, the
				Exalted, or otherwise. If there is someone whose
				occupation requires him to always be traveling, for
				instance, a pilot, a ship captain, truck driver, and so
				on, then he is permitted to shorten his salah or break
				his fast as he is truly traveling.

				The majority of the scholars are of the opinion that it

		<section heading="When the traveler is to pray the complete salah">
			<p>
				A traveler may shorten his salah as long as he is on a
				journey. Likewise if he stays in some place for business
				or some other affair, then he may shorten his salah as
				long as he is there, even for years. If the person
				intends to stay in a place for a certain amount of time
				then, according to Ibn al-Qayyim, he remains a traveler,
				regardless of whether he plans to stay there for a long
				or short time, as long as he does not plan to stay [i.e.,
				reside and not return] in the place that he has traveled
				to. The scholars differ on this point. Summing up and
				giving his own opinion, Ibn al-Qayyim says: "The
				Messenger of Allah stayed in Tabuk for twenty days and
				during that time he shortened his salah and he did not
				say that one may not shorten his salah if he stays longer
				than that, although there is agreement that he did stay
				there for that period of time."
			</p>
			<p>
				In Sahih al-Bukhari, it is recorded that Ibn 'Abbas said:
				"The Prophet stayed, during some of his journeys, for
				nineteen day and he prayed only two rak'at. If we stayed
				in a place for nineteen days, we would not pray the
				complete salah. However, if we stayed longer than that,
				we would perform the whole salah." Ahmad states that ibn
				'Abbas was referring to the Prophet's stay in Makkah at
				the time of its conquest when he said: "The Messenger of
				Allah stayed in Makkah for eighteen days during the time
				of the conquest as he had to go to Hunain and was not
				planning to stay there." This is his interpretation of
				Ibn 'Abbas' statement. Others say that Ibn 'Abbas was
				referring to the Prophet's stay in Tabuk as Jabir ibn
				'Abdullah said: "The Messenger of Allah stayed in Tabuk
				for twenty days and performed qasr salah." Imam Ahmad
				related this in his Musnad. Al-Miswar ibn Makhramah
				reports: "We stayed with Sa'd in some of the cities of
				ash-Sham [Syria] for forty days, and Sa'd would perform
				qasr while we would offer the whole salah." Naf'i
				relates: "Ibn 'Umar was in Azerbaijan for six months, as
				there was snow blocking the pass, and he would pray two
				rak'at." Hafs ibn 'Ubaidullah says: "Anas ibn Malik
				stayed in ash-Sham for two years and he prayed the salah
				of a traveler." Anas relates: "The companions of the
				Prophet stayed in Ram Hurmuz for seven months and they
				shortened their salah." Al-Hassan reports: "I stayed with
				'Abdurrahman ibn Samurah for two years in Kabul, and he
				shortened his salah but he did not combine the salah."
				Ibrahim says: "We resided in Rai for a year or more and
				in Sijistan for two years . . . [and we prayed qasr].
				This is the guidance of the Prophet and his companions,
				and this is the correct position.
			</p>
			<p>
				Concerning other opinions which people follow Imam Ahmad
				say: "If a person intends to stay for four days, he has
				to offer the whole salah and he may offer qasr if his
				intention is for less than that. This is based on an
				interpretation of the reports from the Prophet and his
				companions [i.e., they never intended to stay for longer
				than that and would always say: 'We will leave tomorrow,'
				and so on]. This interpretation is obviously suspect. The
				Prophet conquered Makkah and stayed there to establish
				Islam, eradicate polytheism, and to guide the Arabs. It
				definitely goes, without saying, that such an objective
				does take more than a day or two to complete. Similarly,
				his stay in Tabuk was in preparation for the impending
				war and he knew that this might take longer than just
				four days. In the same way, Ibn 'Umar's stay in
				Azerbaijan for six months, and his praying qasr during
				the entire time was with the knowledge that it takes more
				than two or three days for such snow to melt and the pass
				to become traversable. The same is the case with Anas'
				stay of two years in ash-Sham and his praying qasr and
				the companions' stay in Ram Hurmuz for seven months while
				shortening their prayers. It is well known that
				activities like theirs, such as jihad and guarding, took
				more than four days." The followers of Ahmad maintain:
				"If one is staying in a place for the purpose of jihad or
				due to imprisonment or sickness, then one may shorten
				one's salah regardless of whether the person thinks that
				such a situation may last for a short time or a long
				time." This is correct but there is no proof that such
				conditions have been stipulated in the Qur'an, Sunnah,
				ijma' (consensus), or practice of the Prophet's
				companions. They argued that such conditions are based on
				what is needed for the person to fulfill his need while
				remaining a traveler, and that is what is less than four
				days. His response to them was: 'From where do you derive
				those conditions, while the Prophet sallallahu alehi
				wasallam stayed for more than four days, shortening his
				salah, in Makkah and Tabuk, and he did not mention to
				anyone anything about it and he never told them that he
				never intended to stay for more than four days, even
				though he knew that the people would [strictly] follow
				his actions concerning the salah. They surely followed
				him in his shortening of the salah, and he did not object
				to their praying qasr if they were to stay for more than
				four nights. This should be made clear as it is very
				important. Similarly, the companions (as-sahabah)
				followed him in that and he did not say anything [in
				objection] to those who prayed with him."
			</p>
			<p>
				Malik and ash-Shaf'i say: "If one intends to stay for
				more than four days, he should perform the whole salah,
				and if he intends to stay for less than that, he is to
				offer qasr."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah holds: "If one intends to stay for fifteen
				days, he should do the qasr. If he intends to stay for
				less than that, he should not shorten the salah." This is
				also the opinion of al-Laith ibn Sa'd, and it has also
				been related from three companions: 'Umar, ibn 'Umar, and
				Ibn 'Abbas.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab is of the opinion that: "If you
				stay for four days, you pray four rak'at." A statement
				similar to that of Abu Hanifah's has also been related
				from him. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib says that if one stays for
				ten days, he is to perform the whole salah, and the same
				has been related from Ibn ' Abbas .
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Hassan says: "One who does not get to his destination
				or (city of residence) may shorten salah."
			</p>
			<p>
				'Aishah says: "One who does not put down his provision is
				to shorten the salah."
			</p>
			<p>
				The four imams agree that if one has some need to take
				care of and always has the intention of leaving the next
				day, then he may shorten his salah for as long as he is

				Ibn 'Umar and others are of the opinion that there are no

				the salah and said: "If I were to pray, I would have
				performed the whole salah [as obviously that would have

				of Allah [on joumeys] and he never prayed more than two

				Ibn Qudamah combines what al-Hassan and what Ibn 'Umar

				Most of the people of knowledge are of the opinion that

				of either one of them while traveling, regardless of
				whether the person is actually on the road or has stopped
				at a place for some time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mu'adh reports that while the Prophet was at Tabuk and
				the sun had passed the meridian, the Prophet sallallahu
				alehi wasallam combined the zuhr and 'asr prayers before
				he started his journey. If he started his journey before
				the sun passed its meridian, he would delay the zuhr
				prayer until the time when he stoppped for the 'asr
				prayer. He would do likewise for the maghrib prayer. If
				the sun set before he began his journey, he would combine
				the maghrib and 'isha prayers [at that time]. If he began
				a journey before the sun had set, he would then combine
				them at the time of 'isha. This is related by Abu Dawud
				and at-Tirmidhi who call it hasan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kuraib reported that Ibn 'Abbas said: "Shall I not inform
				you of the salah of the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam
				during a journey?" We said: "Certainly." He said: "If the
				sun passed its meridian while he stopped, he would
				combine the zuhr and 'asr prayers before remounting
				[i.e., moving on]. If the sun had not passed its meridian
				while he had stopped [i.e., before breaking camp], he
				would travel until the time of the 'asr prayer and then
				he would combine the zuhr and 'asr prayers. If the sun
				set while he had stopped, he would combine the magrib and
				'isha prayers. If that did not occur while he had
				stopped, he would ride until the 'isha time and then
				combine them." This is related by Ahmad.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaf'i has something similar in his Musnad, namely
				that when he [the Prophet] set out to travel before the
				sun passed its meridian, he delayed the zuhr prayer and
				combine it with the 'asr during the time of the 'asr
				salah. Al-Baihaqi recorded it with a good chain and he
				says: "To combine the two prayers due to traveling is
				something that is well-known and was practiced by the
				companions of the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam and
				those who followed them."
			</p>
			<p>
				Imam Malik records in al-Muwatta' from Mu'adh that the
				Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam delayed his salah one
				day during the battle of Tabuk and then went and prayed
				the zuhr and 'asr prayers together. Then he returned and
				went back again and said the maghrib and 'isha prayers
				together.
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on this report, ash-Shaf'i says: "His
				statement, 'then he returned and left again,' only refers
				to a situation where the Prophet was staying in a certain
				place [i.e., he was not traveling from one site to
				another] . "
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Qudamah mentions the preceding hadith and writes in
				al-Mughni: "Ibn 'Abdul-Barr said: 'That hadith is sahih
				and its chain is confirmed. The people who are familiar
				with the life history of the Prophet say that the battle
				of Tabuk took place in the ninth year of the hijrah. This
				hadith is a clear proof and the strongest evidence
				against those who claim that one can only combine the
				prayers while one is actually moving from one site to
				another as the Prophet was settled and was not traveling
				since the Prophet was staying in his tent and would come
				out and combine two prayers and then return to his tent.
				Muslim recorded this hadith in his Sahih and stated: 'He
				would pray the zuhr and 'asr together and the maghrib and
				'isha together. One must follow this hadith as it is
				confirmed [to be authentic] and it is a clear statement
				on this rule and there is nothing which contradicts it.
				The permission to combine the salah is a concession for
				anyone who is traveling but it is by no means confined to
				just those times when the person is actually on the road
				[i.e., traveling from one place to another]. The same is
				the case for shortening the salah and for wiping over the
				socks, but it is best to delay it.'"

		<section heading="Having the intention to combine is not a condition for combining or shortening the salah. Ibn Taimiyyah holds: 'That is the position of the majority of the scholars. When the Prophet combined the salah with his companions or shortened the salah with them, he never ordered any of them to make the intention for combining or shortening the salah. In fact, when he left Medinah for Makkah, he prayed two rak'at without combining the salah, and then he prayed the zuhr prayer at 'Arafa without telling the people that he intended to pray the 'asr right afterward, next he prayed the 'asr with them and they did not have the intention to combine their prayers, and in that combination he prayed the latter salah early. When he went from Medinah, he led the people in the 'asr salah at Dhul-Halifah and he did not order them to make the intention to shorten the salah.'">

				A summary of the opinions of the different schools of

			</p>
			<p>
				The Shaf'i school says that it is allowed for the
				resident to combine the zuhr and 'asr or the maghrib and
				'isha, praying each pair in the time of the earlier salah
				only, given that it is raining when one begins the
				earlier prayer and it is still raining by the time one
				begins the second prayer.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the Maliki school, it is allowed to combine
				the maghrib and 'isha in the mosque at the time of the
				maghrib due to rain or expected rain, if there is mud and
				darkness along the way, or if there is a lot of mud and
				it prevents the people from wearing their shoes.
				Nevertheless, he dislikes that the zuhr and 'asr should
				be combined due to rain.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the Hanbali school, it is only allowed to
				combine the maghrib and 'isha in the time of the former
				or the latter due to snow, ice, mud, severe cold, or rain
				which soaks the clothes. This concession is allowed only
				for one who prays with a congregation in the mosque and
				who comes from a distance over which he could be harmed
				by the rain. However, for one who prays in a congregation
				in his house or whose path to the mosque is covered or
				protected, or for one whose house is right next to the
				mosque, it is not allowed to combine the salah.

				Ahmad, Qadi Hussain, al-Khattabi, and al-Mutawali of the
				Shaf'i school are of the opinion that it is allowed to
				combine two prayers, either during the time of the
				earlier or later salah, due to illness as it is a greater
				hardship than rain. An-Nawawi says: "This is a strong
				opinion based on [sound] evidence." In al-Mughni it is
				stated: "The illness which permits one to combine the
				prayers is the one which would otherwise cause hardship
				and more weakness [if he prayed each salah separately]."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanbali school is the most accommodating as it allows
				one to combine the prayers, at the time of the early or
				later salah, for one who is ill as well as for the woman
				who is breast-feeding and will face hardship in cleaning
				her dress for every salah, for the woman who is plagued

			<p>
				The scholars of the Hanbali school and Ishaq are of the

				would pray alJumu'ah and then we would take our camels to
				rest until the sun passed its zenith." This hadith
				clearly states that they prayed al-Jumu'ah before the sun
				passed the meridian. They also cited as proof the hadith
				of 'Abdullah ibn Saidan as-Salmi who said: "We prayed
				al-Jumu'ah with Abu Bakr, and his khutbah and salah were
				before noon. Then we prayed with 'Uthman and his khutbah
				and salah lasted until after the sun had passed the
				meridian, and no one scolded either for it." This is
				related by Ahmad, who cites it as a proof, and by
				ad-Daraqutni. Ahmad adds: "And [something] similar to
				that has been related from ibn Mas'ud, Jabir, Sa'id, and
				Mu'awiyyah. They all prayed before the sun passed the
				meridian and no one objected to what they did, and that
				was the consensus. The majority of the scholars, however,
				interpret the hadith of Jabir as implying that one should
				pray the salah early in its time, when the sun has passed
				the meridian, and not wait until the weather gets cool.
				The prayer and the resting of the camels was right after
				the sun passed the meridian. As to the report from
				'Abdullah ibn Saidan, these scholars consdier it weak.
				Ibn Hajar writes about him: 'He is one of the major

				they would have performed their prescribed duty. If one
				of them delivers the khutbah, they would be following
				what is sunnah; and if they leave the khutbah, then it is
				only the sunnah which they have neglected, (not something
				which was obligatory). But for the hadith of Tariq ibn
				Shihab which clearly requires every Muslim to offer it in
				congregation and the fact that the Prophet sallallahu
				alehi wasallam always performed it in a congregation,
				offering it individually, like the rest of the prayers,
				would have been quite acceptable. Concerning the
				statement "from four people to the ruler of the area,"
				that is certainly not the Prophet's statement nor of any
				of his companions... In fact, [this is] a statement of
				al-Hassan al-Basri. As to various statements and
				psuedojuristic opinions concerning this noble worship,
				the Friday prayer, which Allah has prescribed once a week
				as one of the signs of Islam, a little consideration
				should suffice to show their superfluity and error. One
				of these is the amazing statement that khutbah is
				equivalent to two rak'at of salah, and if one misses it,
				then his jumu'ah is not valid. They seem to be quite
				ignorant of what has been related from the Prophet
				through a number of chains which support each other that
				"if a person misses one rak'ah, then he is to perform
				another rak'ah and his salah would be completed." Have
				not other ahadith reached them that are valid in such
				matters? Some say that one cannot perform the Jumu'ah
				unless there are three people with the imam and others
				hold that four people are needed, while yet others
				stipulate seven people! Still others say nine, and some
				think twelve, twenty, thirty, and there are even some who
				think forty, fifty, seventy, and every number that is
				between those numbers! Some hold that many people have to
				be present without specifying a particular number, while
				others state that al-Jumu'ah may only be performed in a
				city in which there is a "congregational mosque." Some
				are convinced that there have to be so many thousand
				people living in the area. Some hold that there has to be
				a congregational mosque and a public restroom. Yet others
				propose that the prayer is not obligatory unless there is
				a well-known and established imam; if such an imam cannot
				be found or if his credibility is doubtful, then the
				Friday salah is neither obligatory nor legitimate....No
				such statement can be found [in the book of Allah or in
				the sunnah] to support what they claim to be the
				conditions or prerequisites of the Jumu'ah... Whoever
				comes with such gibberish must be refuted for the only
				criterion is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His
				Messenger. As Allah says in the Qur'an: "If you dispute
				concerning any matter, refer it to Allah and the
				Messenger"; "The answer of the believers, when summoned
				to Allah and His Messenger, in order that he may judge
				between them is no other than this: they say: "We hear
				and we obey"; "But no, by thy Lord, they can have no
				(real) faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes
				between them, and find in their souls no resistance
				against thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest
				conviction." Those verses and others similar to them are
				the clearest evidence that one must return to the rule of
				Allah and His Messenger if there is any dispute. The rule
				of Allah is the Book of Allah. The rule of the Messenger,
				after his passing away, is his sunnah and nothing other
				than that. Also, Allah did not endow any of his slaves -
				even if he reaches the highest degree of knowledge and
				has accumulated what no one else has - with the right to
				make any statement concerning this religion without any
				authority from the Book or the Sunnah. Likewise, if a
				mujtahid (jurisconsult) should take liberty of proposing
				an opinion without substantiating it, then it is not
				permissible for anyone to follow him in that, regardless
				of who he may be. I, as Allah knows, am always greatly
				astonished by this type of writers and their writings
				which supposedly provide guidance in one's creed and
				practice but which are filled with gibberish. This is not
				limited to only some of the schools among the different
				schools of law, or only certain areas from among the
				different areas, or only certain eras from among all of
				the eras [it is found in all of these schools of law,
				areas, and eras]! In fact, the later people follow the
				earlier people [in such things] as if they were following
				the umm al-kitab [mother of the Book], although, [they
				follow] distorted teachings.

		<section heading="Ruling concerning khutbah">
			<p>
				The majority of the people of knowledge are of the
				opinion that khutbahtul Jumu'ah is obligatory and they
				support this by the confirmed hadith which state that the
				Prophet always made the khutbah with the Jumu'ah. In
				their support they also quote the saying of the Prophet:
				"Pray as you see me pray," and the Qur'anic verse: "O you
				who believe, when the call is proclaimed for salatul
				jumu'ah, hasten unto the remembrance of Allah." This
				verse contains an order to hasten unto the remembrance,
				which implies it is obligatory, and (the scholars)
				interpret the remembrance of Allah to include the
				khutbatul Jumu'ah. AshShaukani refutes the first argument
				by saying that hadith simply states the action of the
				Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam and does not
				necessarily prove that such an action is obligatory. As
				to the verse, he regards it as simply a command to be
				present at the salah which is obligatory and excludes
				khutbah... Regarding their argument relating to the
				commandment to "hasten unto the rememberance of Allah,"
				he says it refers to salah only, which is the real cause
				for making haste. There is, however, an agreement that
				the Friday salah is obligatory while there is a dispute
				over whether or not the khutbah is obligatory.
				Ash-Shaukani concludes by saying that apparently the
				correct view is the one held by al-Hassan al-Basri, Dawud
				az-Zahiri and al-Juwaini, that the khutbah is only a
				highly recommended act.

				The imam should greet the people when he comes upon the

			<p>
				Jabir reports that when the Prophet mounted the pulpit,
				he would greet the people. This is related by Ibn Majah
				and in its chain is Ibn Lahiya, and al-Athram has
				recorded it in his Sunnan from ash-Sha'biy, on the
				authority of the Prophtet, in mursal form. Ata' and
				others also reported in mursal form that when the Prophet
				walked to the top of the pulpit, he would turn to the
				people and say: "Peace be upon you." According to
				ashSha'biy: "Abu Bakr and 'Umar used to do that [also]."
			</p>
			<p>
				As-Sa'ib ibn Yazid informs: "The first adhan to salah
				made on the day of Jumu'ah was made when the imam sat
				upon the pulpit during the time of the Prophet, Abu Bakr,
				and 'Umar. Then, during the time of 'Uthman, since there
				were many people, he instituted a third adhan outside the
				mosque. The Prophet only had one mu'adhdhin." This is
				related by alBukhari, an-Nasa'i, and Abu Dawud. In
				another narration, it is stated: "During the time of
				'Uthman, there were many people, so 'Uthman ordered the
				people to make a third call to salah on the day of
				Jumu'ah, outside of the mosque, and that practice has
				continued."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad and an-Nasa'i record: "Bilal would make the adhan

				'Adi ibn-Thabit relates from his father on the authority

				In another version, it is stated: "The Friday khutbah

				defective hand." This is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and
				at-Tirmidhi.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Mas'ud reports that the Prophet would say in his
				opening testimony: "All praise be to Allah, we seek His
				aid and we seek His forgiveness and we seek refuge in
				Allah from the evil of our souls. Whomever Allah guides,

			<p>
				Umm Hisham bint Harithah ibn an-Nu'man says: "I learnt
				[Surah] Qaf of the Glorious Qur'an from the Prophet for

				an-Nasa' i, and Abu Dawud .

			<p>
				Ya'la ibn Umayyah reports that he heard the Prophet
				recite, while on the pulpit: "And they cry: O Malik!..."
				(az-Zukhruf 77). This is related by al-Bukhari and
				Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Majah records from Ubayy that the Messenger of Allah
				recited: "Blessed is He..." [Surah al-Mulk] on Friday
				while he was standing. In ar-Raudah an-Nadiyah, it is
				stated: "Thus the required khutbah, in terms of Islamic
				law, should be modeled after the Prophet's khutbah
				exhorting people to do good and warning them against dire
				consequences of the evil. This is the spirit of the
				address which the Islamic law has instituted. As to the
				other contents of the khutbah, like praising Allah,
				saying prayers upon His Messengers or reciting a portion
				of the Qur'an, none of these is its main purpose, which
				is to admonish people... It has been customary among the
				Muslims [in the light of the sunnah] that if one wanted
				to make some sort of proclamation, he would begin with
				praises of Allah and prayers upon His Prophet, or
				something of that nature. Still, that is not the purpose
				of the khutbah; indeed, the purpose is that which is said
				after praises of Allah and prayers for the prophet. If a
				person delivers a khutbah and confines it to only
				praising Allah and saying prayers upon the Prophet, his
				khutbah would hardly be acceptable. Any person with
				common sense could understand that.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is the admonitary aspect of the Friday khutbah which
				the hadith emphasise, and if a khatib makes an
				admonition, he fulfills the purpose of shari'ah; if he
				precedes his khutbah with praises of Allah and prayers
				upon the Prophet and during his admonitions he uses
				Qur'anic verses, then he does it in a complete and
				satisfactory manner."

				Giving his views on the subject, Ibn al-Qayyim says: "The
				khutbah of the Prophet reinforced the fundamental
				articles of faith, like belief in Allah, the Exalted, His
				angels, His books, His messengers, and the meeting with
				Him. He would mention the paradise and the hellfire and
				what Allah, the Exalted, has promised to His devoted
				servants and the people who obey Him and what Allah has
				promised to His enemies and the miscreant. While
				listening to his khutbah, the hearts would be filled with
				belief in Allah, His oneness, and His majesty. His
				khutbahs were not like speeches of those who speak only
				of matters of concern of common folk, lamenting earthly
				life and frightening people of the approaching death.
				Such speeches cannot inspire faith in Allah or strengthen
				belief in His oneness or move people by allusion to His
				mighty works in history, nor can they kindle in hearts
				intense love for Allah, making the listeners look forward
				eagerly to the time they will meet Him! The people who
				hear such speeches gain no benefit at all, except that
				they will die and that their wealth will be distributed
				and their bodies will be turned to dust. Woe to such
				poets, what sort of faith is fostered by such sermons,
				and what sort of tawhid do they teach or knowledge
				disseminate? If we study the khutbahs of the Prophet
				sallallahu alehi wasallam and his companions, we find
				them  embued with perspicuous guidance, tawhid,
				attributes of Allah, explaining the basic articles of the
				faith, inviting people to Allah, and drawing their
				attention to His providential care that makes Him so
				beloved to His slaves. His khutbahs referred to Allah's
				dealings with others in the past so as to wam his
				listeners against His wrath and exhort them to remember
				Him, thank Him and win His pleasure and love. Those who
				heard these khutbahs were inspired with the love of Allah
				and they looked forward eagerly to meeting their Lord. As
				time went by, the example of the Prophet was forgotten

				It is a sunnah to pray four rak'at or two rak'at after
				al-Jumu'ah: Abu Hurairah reports that the Prophet
				sallallahu alehi wasallam said: "Whoever is to pray after
				the Jumu'ah should pray four rak'at." This is related by
				Muslim, Abu Dawud, and at-Tirmidhi.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar says: "The Prophet would pray two rak'at in his
				house on the day of Jumu'ah." This is related by the
				group.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim says: "After the Prophet finished the
				Jumu'ah, he would enter his house and pray two rak'at,
				and he ordered those who prayed the Jumu'ah to pray four
				rak'at after it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our sheikh Ibn Taimiyyah says: 'When he prayed in the
				mosque, he would pray four [rak'at], and when he prayed
				in his house, he would pray two rak'at.' I say: this is
				what the hadith is pointing to. Abu Dawud records from
				ibn 'Umar that when he prayed in the mosque, he would
				pray four rak'at, and when he prayed in his house, he
				would pray two rak'at. Also, in the two Sahihs it is
				reported from ibn 'Umar that the Prophet would pray two
				rak'at in his house after the Friday salah."
			</p>
			<p>
				If one prays four rak'at, then, according to some, he is
				to pray them all connected, while others hold that he is
				to pray two rak'at, make the taslim, followed by another
				two rak'at. It is preferred to pray them in one's house.
				If one prays them in the mosque, he should change his
				place of prayer after the Friday salah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Concerning any sunnah prayer before the Friday salah, Ibn
				Taimiyyah writes: "The Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam
				never offered any salah after the adhan and before the
				Friday salah, and no one has ever related such an act
				from him. During the Prophet's time, there was only one
				adhan and that was made when the Prophet sat upon the
				pulpit. Bilal would make the adhan and then the Prophet
				would give the two khutbahs. Next, Bilal would make the
				iqamah and the Prophet would lead the people in salah. It
				is not possible that the Prophet would have made a salah
				after the adhan nor anyone else among the Muslims who
				prayed with the Prophet could have done so. And we have
				no evidence to show that the Prophet, sallallahu alehi
				wasallam, prayed in his house before going out to the
				mosque on Friday. He did not specify any time for any
				salah before the Friday salah. What he said was meant to
				exhort those going early to the mosque on Friday to
				engage themselves in prayer. He said: 'Whoever goes out
				early and walks and does not ride to the mosque and prays
				what has been prescribed [by Allah] for him...' That has
				been related from the Prophet's companions. When they
				would reach the mosque on Friday, they would pray
				whatever amount was easy for them. Some of them prayed
				ten rak'at and some prayed twelve and some only eight and
				others less than that. For this reason most of the
				scholars are of the opinion that there is no sunnah
				prayer with a specified number of rak'ah or time, before
				aljumu'ah, for there is nothing either in the actions or
				statements of the Prophet to support or confirm it.

				The 'id prayer consists of two rak'at during which it is

				opening takbir and before the Qur'anic recital in the
				first rak'ah. During the second rak'ah, one makes takbir
				five times after the takbir which is customarily made for
				standing after the prostration. One is to raise one's
				hands during each pronouncement of the takbir. This is

			<p>
				'Amr ibn Shu'aib reports from his father on the authority

				takbirat during the 'id prayer, seven in the first rak'ah
				and five in the second. He did not pray before or after
				the 'id. This is related by Ahmad and Ibn Majah. Ahmad
				says: "I follow that."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Dawud and ad-Daraqutni report that the Prophet said:
				"The takbirat during the ['id of  breaking the fast are
				seven in the first rak'ah and five in the second, and the
				Qur'anic recital comes after them in both the rak'at."
				This is the strongest opinion and it is the opinion of
				the majority of the people of knowledge from among the
				companions, the successors, and the imams. Ibn Abdul-Barr
				commenting on the number of takbirat, says: "It has been
				related through many good chains that the Prophet made
				seven takbirat in the first rak'ah and five in the
				second. Such has been related from 'Abdullah ibn 'Amr,
				Ibn 'Umar, Jabir, 'Aishah. Abu Waqid, and 'Amer ibn 'Auf
				al-Mazni. Nothing that has been related from him, either
				through a stonger or weaker chain, differs from that, and
				it was the first to be practiced."
			</p>
			<p>
				As to the pause between takbirat, it is said that the
				Prophet would be silent for a short period of time
				between the takbirat, and nothing has been related from
				him concerning exactly what he said during that pause;
				however, at-Tabarani and al-Baihai relate, with a strong
				chain, that Ibn Mas'ud would praise and  extol Allah, the
				Exalted, and make prayers upon the Prophet during such
				intervals. The same has been recorded from Hudhaifah and
				Abu  Musa. Pronouncing the takbirat are a sunnah even
				though the salah is not invalidated if one neglects them,
				either intentionally or out of forgetfulness.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Qudamah says: "I know of no difference of opinion on
				that point." Ash-Shaukani states that the strongest
				opinion is that if one does not perform the takbirat out
				of forgetfulness, he is not to perform the prostrations

				The khutbah after salatul id is a sunnah and so is

				the musalla (prayer place) and begin with the salah and
				when he finished, he would face the people while the
				people were sitting in rows, and he would admonish them,
				advise them, and exhort them [to do good deeds]. And if
				he wished to send off an army or order something, he
				would do so and then leave." Abu Sa'id then says: "The
				people continued to act likewise until I went out with
				Marwan, while he was the govenor of Medinah, for one of
				the two 'ids. When I arrived at the place of prayer, I
				found a minbar that was built by Kathir ibn as-Salt. When
				Marwan went to mount it before the prayer, I pulled him
				by his clothes. He pushed me away and gave the khutbah
				before the salah. I said to him: 'By Allah you have
				changed [the order].' He said: 'O Abu Sa'id...what you
				know is gone.' I said: 'By Allah, what I know is better
				than what I don't know.' He said: 'The people would not
				stay with us after the salah so we made the khutbah
				before the salah.'" This is related by al-Bukhari and
				Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Abdullah ibn as-Sa'ib said: "I prayed the 'id salah with
				the Messenger of Allah and when he finished the salah he
				said: 'We will be delivering a khutbah. Whoever wishes to
				stay for the khutbah may stay. Whoever would like to
				leave, may leave . ' " This is related by an-Nasa' i, Abu
				Dawud, and Ibn Majah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever has been recorded suggests that there are two
				khutbahs for the 'id and the imam sits between them
				[i.e., like the khutbatul Jumu'ah]. Such reports are
				considered weak. An-Nawawi says: "There is nothing at all
				substantiated about there being more than one khutbah."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim writes: "The Prophet would begin all of his
				khutbahs with the praise of Allah and there is no hadith
				from him that states that he began his 'id khutbahs with
				takbir.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Majah recorded in his Sunan from Sa'id, the
				mu'adhdhin of the Prophet, that the Prophet would say the
				takbir during his khutbahs and even more so during the
				'id khutbahs. Still, this does not prove that he began
				his khutbah with it! The people differ over the beginning
				of the 'id and the khutbah for salatul istisqa' (prayer
				for rain). Some say that they are to begin with takbir.
				Some say that the khutbah for salatul istisqa' begins
				with praying for forgiveness while others say it begins
				with praises of Allah." Shaikh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah
				says: "That is correct as the Prophet said: 'Every affair
				that does not begin with the praise of Allah is
				deficient.' The Prophet began all of his speeches with
				praises of Allah. Concerning the statement of many
				jurists, i.e.. he began the 'prayer for rain' by asking
				forgiveness from Allah and the id speech with takbir,
				there is absolutely no proof for it in the Prophet's
				sunnah. In fact the sunnah contradicts that statement as
				he began all of his speeches with the praises of Allah."

				'Slaves of Allah, you play the pipes of the Satan!' He
				said it three times. The Prophet said to him: 'O Abu
				Bakr, every people have a festival and this is our
				festival."' In al-Bukhari's version, 'Aishah said: "The
				Messenger of Allah, entered the house and I had two girls
				who were singing about the battle of Bu'ath. The Prophet
				lied down on the bed and turned his face to the other
				direction. Abu Bakr entered and spoke harshly to me,
				'Musical instruments of the Satan in the presence of the
				Messenger of Allah!' The Messenger of Allah turned his
				face to him and said: 'Leave them.' When Abu Bakr became
				inattentive I signaled to the girls to leave. It was the
				day of 'id and the Africans were performing with their
				shields and spears. Either I asked him or the Prophet
				asked if I would like to watch them [I don't recall now].
				I replied in the affirmative. At this the Prophet made me
				stand behind him and my cheek was against his. He was
				saying: 'Carry on, O tribe of Arfadah,' until I tired.
				The Prophet asked: 'Is that enough for you?' I replied:
				"yes," so he said: 'Leave [then].'"

				Ibn Hajar writes in Fath al-Bari, "Ibn as-Siraj related

		<section heading="Takbirat during the days of 'id">
			<p>
				It is a sunnah to pronounce the takbirat on 'id days.
				Concerning the 'id of breaking the fast, Allah says "you
				should complete the prescribed period and that you should
				glorify Allah [i.e., say takbirat] for having guided you
				and that you may give thanks." Concerning the 'id of the
				sacrifice, Allah says: "that you may remember Allah
				during the well known days;" and: "He has made them
				subject to you, that you may glorify Allah for His
				guidance to you.  The majority of the scholars say that
				the time for the takbirat during the 'id of breaking the
				fast is from the time one goes to the 'id prayer until
				the khutbah begins. Weak hadith have been recorded
				stating this, but there are also authentic reports from
				Ibn 'Umar and other companions that they did so. Al-Hakim
				says: "This sunnah has been practiced by ahl-il hadith.
				Malik, Ahmad, Ishaq, and Abu Thaur [have made statements
				concurring that practice] ."
			</p>
			<p>
				Some say that the takbirat are from the night before the
				'id, when the moon is seen, until the person goes to the
				musalla and the imam arrives. The time for the takbirat
				during the 'id of the sacrifice is from the day of
				'Arafah until the time of the 'asr on the thirteenth of
				Dhul-Hijjah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Hajar writes in Fath al-Bari: "None of that has been
				confirmed from the Prophet. The most authentic report
				from the companions is that 'Ali and Ibn Mas'ud would
				make the takbirat from the day of 'Arafah to the 'asr of
				the last day of Mina. Ibn al-Mundhir and others reported
				it. AshShaf'i, Ahamd, Abu Yusuf, and Muhammad follow that
				report and it is also the view of 'Umar and Ibn 'Abbas."
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no specific time for the takbirat during the
				days of tashriq (three days after 'idul adha). In fact,
				it is preferred to pronounce takbirat during every moment
				of those days.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Bukhari recorded: "During 'Umar's stay at Mina, he
				would say takbirat in his tent [so loud] that the people
				in the mosque would hear it and then they would start
				doing it also and the people in the market place would do
				the same and all of Mina would resound with the takbirat.
				Ibn 'Umar used to say the takbirat, during those days of
				Mina, after the prayers and while on his bed, in his
				tent, while sitting and while walking during all of those
				days. Maimuna would say the takbirat on the day of
				sacrifice. The women used to say takbirat behind Abban
				ibn 'Uthman and 'Umar ibn 'Abdulaziz along with the men
				in the mosque during the days of tashriq." Al-Hafiz ibn
				Hajar said: "These reports show that the takbirat are
				made during all the times of these days, after salah and
				all other times. Some say the takbirat are made only
				after the salah, and some say they are to be made only
				after the fard prayers and not after nawafl, others
				declare them to be for men and not for women, while some
				say that they are only to be said in congregations and
				not individually, while others reserve them only for
				those who perform the salah on time and not for those who
				are making up a missed prayer, and some say only for
				residents and not travellers, whereas others think they
				are only for the people of the city and not for the
				people of the countryside. Apparently al-Bukhari is of
				the opinion that it is for all people and the reports
				that he has transmitted support his opinion."
			</p>
			<p>
				These takbirat can be made in many different forms. The
				most authentic form is that which has been recorded with
				a sahih chain by 'Abdurrazaq from Salman, who said: "They
				made takbirat with: 'Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu
				akbar kabeera."' From 'Umar and ibn Mas'ud the following
				is related: "Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar. La ilaha
				illallah. Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar wa lillahil-hamd."

		<section heading="Zakah, definition">
			<p>
				Zakah or alms tax can be defined as that portion of a
				man's wealth which is designated for the poor. The term
				is derived from the Arabic verbal root meaning "to
				increase." "to purify," and "to bless." It find its
				origin in Allah's command to: "Take sadaqah (charity)
				from their property in order to purify and sanctify them"
				[at-Taubah 103]. That is why this kind of sadaqah is
				called zakah, for by paying it, one is aspiring to attain
				blessing, purification, and the cultivation of good
				deeds.
			</p>
			<p>
				Taking into account its very nature, it is no wonder that
				zakah constitutes one of the five pillars of Islam. It is
				associated with prayer (salah) in eighty-two Qur'anic
				verses. Allah, the Exalted One, prescribed it in His Book
				(The Qur'an), His Messenger corroborated it by his
				(sunnah), and the community (ummah) by consensus  upheld
				it. Ibn 'Abbas reported that when the Prophet, upon whom
				be peace, sent Mu'adh ibn Jabal to Yemen (as its
				governor), he said to him: "You are going to a people who
				are People of the Scripture. Invite them to accept the
				shahadah: that there is no god but Allah and I am His
				Messenger. If they accept and affirm this, tell them that
				Allah, the Glorious One, has enjoined five prayers upon
				them during the day and night. If they accept that, tell
				them also that He has enjoined sadaqah upon their assets
				which will be taken from the rich of the (Muslim)
				community and distributed to the poor. If they accept
				that, refrain from laying hands upon the best of their
				goods and fear the cry of the oppressed, for there is no
				barrier between Allah and it."
			</p>
			<p>
				At-Tabarani relates in al-'Awsat and as-Saghir, on the
				authority of 'Ali, that the Prophet said: "Allah has
				enjoined upon rich Muslims a due to be taken from their
				properties corresponding to the needs of the poor among
				them. The poor will never suffer from starvation or lack
				of clothes unless the rich neglect their due. If they do,
				Allah will surely hold them accountable and punish them
				severely." According to at-Tabarani: "It was reported
				only by Thabit ibn Muhammad az-Zahid." Of Thabit's
				credibility, al-Hafiz in turn says: "Thabit was an honest
				and trustworthy person. AlBukhari and others related from
				him, and the rest of the narrators in the chain are
				considered as accepted authorities."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the early days of Islam at Makkah, no limit or
				restriction was placed on the amount to be donated, for
				that decision was left to the individual Muslim's
				conscience and generosity. In the second year of hijrah,
				according to the widely known authorities, both the type
				and the quantity of zakah revenues were determined, and
				detailed illustrations were provided.

		<section heading="Exhortation to Give Zakah in the Qur'an">
			<p>
				At-Taubah 103 authorizes the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				to take either a stipulated amount of alms from the
				believers' holdings in the form of the obligatory zakah,
				or a voluntary, unstipulated amount (zakah of tatawwul).
				In this 'ayah, "purify" means to purify them from
				stinginess, greed, and meanness, and a lack of remorse
				toward the poor and the wretched. To sanctify them is to
				raise them in esteem through good deeds and blessings so
				that they will be worthy of happiness both now and in the
				afterlife.
			</p>
			<p>
				In reference to the life hereafter, Allah reveals: "Lo!
				Those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens and
				watersprings, taking that which their Lord gives them.
				For they were before doers of good. They used to sleep
				but little of the night, and in the hours of the early
				dawn they prayed for forgiveness.... In their wealth, the
				beggar and the outcast had due share" [adh-Dhariyat
				15-19]. Allah views beneficence and righteousness as
				exclusive qualities of the pious. It is because of their
				beneficence that they pray at night and ask Allah's
				forgiveness at dawn as a way of worshipping and
				approaching Him. Their beneficence is likewise in their
				giving to the needy their share of mercy and sympathy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Allah further confirms: "And the believers, men and
				women, are protecting friends of one another; they enjoin
				the right and forbid the wrong, they perform prayer and
				pay the zakah, and they obey Allah and His Messenger.
				Upon them, Allah will have mercy" [at-Taubah 71].
			</p>
			<p>
				Such are the people blessed by Allah and given His
				mercy-- those who believe in Him, who take care of each
				other through support and love, who exhort fairness and
				restrain lewd behavior, who have strong ties with Allah
				through prayer, and who strengthen their mutual relations
				through zakah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, these people, as reflected in al-Hajj 41, are:
				"Those who, if we give them power in the land, perform
				prayers and pay zakah, and enjoin kindness and forbid
				inequity." Giving zakah is, therefore, one of the reasons
				for which the righteous are given authority on earth.

				At-Tirmidhi relates from Abu Kabshah alAnmari that the

				(things) and ask you to memorize my words: Sadaqah taken
				from a property never decreases it; a man who suffers
				injustice and is patient with it, Allah will grant him
				strength; a man who starts begging, Allah will cause him
				to be poor."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad and at-Tirmidhi relate (and the latter graded it

				upon whom be peace, said: "Allah receives charity by His
				right hand, and then He causes it to grow for each of
				you. Just as you raise a horse, colt, foal, or young
				weaned camel, so that morsel becomes as large as the
				Mount of 'Uhud."
			</p>
			<p>
				Of this hadith's content, Waki' says: "This is sanctioned
				by the Qur'an: 'Do they not know that it is Allah alone
				who can accept the repentance of His servants and is the
				(true) recipient of whatever is offered for His sake -
				and that Allah alone is an acceptor of repentance, a

				usurious gains of all blessing, whereas He blesses
				charitable deeds with manifold increase.' [al Baqarah
				276]."
			</p>
			<p>
				Again, Ahmad relates, with a sound chain of narrators,
				that Anas said: "A man from the tribe of Tameem came to
				the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, and said: 'O
				Messenger of Allah! I have plenty of property, a large
				family, a great deal of money, and I am a gracious host
				to my guests. Tell me how to conduct my life and how to
				spend.' The Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace,
				replied: 'Pay zakah out of your property, for truly it is
				a purifier which purifies you, and be kind to your
				relatives, and acknowledge the rights of the poor,
				neighbors, and beggars'."
			</p>
			<p>
				It was reported from 'Aishah that the Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, said: "I swear upon three things:
				Allah does not equate one who has a portion in Islam with
				one who does not. The portions of Islam are three:
				prayer, fasting, and zakah. If Allah takes care of a man
				in this world, He will take care of him on the Day of
				Judgment. If a man likes a group of people, Allah will
				certainly include him among them. As for the fourth, if I
				swear on it, I hope I will not commit a sin: that if
				Allah conceals a man's sin in this world, He will
				certainly not expose him on the Day of Judgment."
			</p>
			<p>
				At-Tabarani relates in al-'Awsat, that Jabir reported: "A

				for a man who pays zakah on his assets?' The Messenger of
				Allah, upon whom be peace, said: 'For one who pays zakah
				on his asssets, he will be removed from the evil in

			<p>
				On the same subject, al-Bukhari and Muslim relate that

		<section heading="Judgment on the Zakah Refrainer">
			<p>
				As an obligation upon Muslims, zakah is one of the
				essential requirements of Islam. If somebody disputed its
				obligation, he would be outside of Islam, and could
				legally be killed for his unbelief unless he was a new
				Muslim and could be excused for his ignorance.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the one who refrains from paying it without
				denying its obligation, he would be guilty of committing
				a sin. Yet, this act does not place him outside of Islam.
				It is the ruler's duty to take zakah from the defaulter
				by force and rebuke him, provided he does not collect
				more than the stipulated amount. However, in the views of
				Ahmad and ash-Shaf'i (in his earlier opinion) the ruler
				could take half of the defaulter's money, in addition to
				the calculated amount of zakah, as a punishment. This
				view is based on what Ahmad, anNasa'i, Abu Dawud,
				al-Hakim, and al-Baihaqi have recorded from Bahz ibn
				Hakim all the way back to his grandfather who said: "I
				heard the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, say:
				'Whether the camels of the zakah payer are grown or baby
				camels, it makes no difference in his reward if he gave
				them willingly. (However,) if someone refrains from
				paying it, it will be taken from him along with half his
				property, for it is a right of our Lord, the Blessed and
				the Exalted, not a right of the house of Muhammad.'"
			</p>
			<p>
				Asked about its chain, Ahmad ruled it good (hassan). Of
				Bahz, al-Hakim says: "His traditions are authentic."
				Ash-Shaf'i, as alBaihaqi says, did not include it for
				fiqhi consideration because . . . "this hadith is not
				confirmed by the scholars of hadith."
			</p>
			<p>
				If some people refrain from paying zakah knowing that it

				His Messenger, and they uphold the prayers, and pay the

			<p>
				Zakah must be paid by every Muslim who has a nisab, which
				is the minimum of one's holdings liable to zakah. The
				nisab is conditioned by the following:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Zakah should be paid on any amount of money
					remaining after meeting the expenses for such
					necessities as food, clothes, housing, vehicles
					and craft machines.
				</li>
				<li>
					A complete year of Islamic calendar should pass,
					starting from the very day of the nisab's
					possession, without any decrease during the year.
					In case of its decrease (being less than nisab),
					the year count (hawl;) starts from the day of the
					nisab completion.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Commenting on the issue, an-Nawawi said: "In our view and
				the views of Malik, Ahmad, and the majority of scholars,
				the amount of property liable for payment of zakah, such
				as gold, silver, or cattle, is tied to the completion of
				nisab through the turn of a whole year. If the nisab
				decreases in any time of the year, [the counting of] the
				year discontinues. Later, if the nisab is completed, the
				year count is resumed from the time of its completion."
			</p>
			<p>
				On the same subject, Abu Hanifah holds: "What matters
				isthe availability of nisab at the beginning and end of
				the year. Its decrease at any time in between does not
				matter, even though the zakah payer had two hundred
				dirhams and he lost all but one dirham during the year,
				or if he had forty sheep, all of which died except for
				one during the year. If, at the end of the year, he had
				two hundred dirhams, or forty sheep, then he must pay
				zakah on all of that. This condition is not applicable to
				the zakah of plantations and fruits, for their zakah
				should be paid on the harvest day. Allah, the Exalted
				One, says: 'And pay the due thereof upon the harvest day'
				[alA'raf 142]."
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-'Abdari elaborated that: "The holdings subject to
				zakah are of two kinds. The first kind grows by itself:
				crops and fruits. The second kind is used for growing and
				production: money, merchandise, and cattle. In the former
				case, zakah should be paid at the time of harvest. In the
				latter case, it should be paid at the end of the haul.
				This was the opinion of all jurists as reported in
				anNawawi's al-Majrnu'."

				his zakah before the hawl. Al-Hasan was once asked if a

				fulfilled his obligation. Al-Hasan answered in the

				discharged if the zakah is paid before the expiration of
				the year. They formulated their stance on the Prophet's
				hadith, already mentioned, which makes the zakah
				mandatory for the payer only when he has his possessions
				for a year. However, this does not invalidate the view of
				those who maintain that paying zakah in advance is
				lawful, for undeniably the obligation of zakah is
				associated with the expiry of one full year. The
				difference is only on the point of whether one's

				There is, however, disagreement over whether women's gold

				Prophet said: 'Do you want Allah to make you wear
				bracelets of fire on the Day of Judgment?' They answered:

			</p>
			<p>
				In the same way, Asma' bint Yazid reported: "My aunt and
				I, while wearing gold bracelets, went to the Prophet,
				upon whom be peace. He asked: 'Did you pay their zakah?'
				She related that they had not. The Prophet said: 'Do you
				not fear that Allah will make you wear a bracelet of
				fire? Pay its zakah.' " Al-Haythami confirms that it was

				Thereupon, he asked: 'What is this, 'Aishah?' I replied:
				'I made them to adorn myself for you, O Messenger of
				Allah.' He said: 'Did you pay their zakah?' I said: 'No,
				or what Allah wishes.' Then he said: 'Their punishment in
				Hell is enough for you.' " This is related by Abu Dawud,
				ad-Daraqutni, and al-Baihaqi.

				asked if jewelry was subject to zakah. He replied that it
				was not, even if its value exceeded one thousand dinars.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Baihaqi also narrates the case of Asma': "Asma' bint
				Abu Bakr used to adorn her daughters with gold. Although
				its value was around fifty thousand dinars, she did not
				pay zakah on it."
			</p>
			<p>
				It is related in al-Muwatta' from 'Abdurrahman ibn

				of her nieces, who were orphans under her protection, and
				adorned them with jewelry without paying its zakah. Also
				in al-Muwatta' it is related that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar
				used to adorn his daughters and slave girls with gold
				without paying zakah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Summing up the subject, al-Khattabi concludes: "What
				appears in the Qur'an supports the view of those who hold
				that zakah is obligatory on gold and silver, and the
				traditions also support this. Those who did not consider
				it obligatory based their view on speculation and some of
				the traditions. However, to be on the safe side, it is
				better to pay." These different views deal with allowable
				gold or silver adornment. As for other adornments which

				adornment--their zakah should be paid. The same rule is
				applied to gold or silver utensils.

				if the woman has accumulated a nisab other than the

				The majority of scholars among the companions, the
				followers, the generation after them, and the jurists who
				came subsequently held that zakah on merchandise is
				compulsory. Abu Dawud and alBaihaqi relate that Samurah
				ibn Jundub reported: "The Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				used to command us to pay sadaqah from [the goods] we had
				for sale." Ad-Daraqutni and al-Baihaqi relate that Abu
				Dharr reported the Prophet, upon whom be peace, saying:
				"There is sadaqah on camels, sheep, cows, and house
				furniture." Ash-Shaf'i, Ahmad, Abu 'Ubaid, ad-Daraqutni,
				al-Baihaqi, and 'Abd ur-Razzaq relate that Abu 'Amr ibn
				Hammas reported from his father that he said: "I used to
				sell leather and containers. Once, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
				passed by me and said: 'Pay the sadaqah due on your
				property.' I said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is
				just leather.' He replied: 'Evaluate it and then pay its
				due sadaqah.' "
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on its credentials, Ibn Quadmah says in
				alMughni that this is a kind of story which is well-known
				and indisputable. This might be a consensus of opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, the Zahiriyyah maintain that
				merchandise is not subject to zakah. They differ, says
				Ibn Rushd, because of their use of analogical reasoning
				to the obligation of zakah and because of their
				disagreement on the authenticity of Samurah's and Abu
				Dharr's reports.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the majority of jurists view merchandise as a
				property which increases in value. Hence, by analogy, it
				is similar to the three categories upon which zakah must
				be paid: plantations, cattle, and gold and silver.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is stated in al-Mandr: "Most scholars agree that zakah
				is obligatory on merchandise even though there is no
				clear-cut ruling in the Qur'an or the sunnah on this
				issue. However, there are a number of reports that
				corroborate each other with regard to the evidence
				provided by [their] texts. Their rationale is that since
				merchandise is a form of cash, there is no difference
				between it and dinars or dirhams in terms of which it is
				valued. This means that the form of the nisab can
				alternate between value in the form of cash and that
				which is valued in the form of merchandise. If zakah had
				not been obligatory on merchandise, the rich--or most of
				them --would have converted their cash into merchandise
				for trading purposes, making sure that the nisab of gold
				and silver is never possessed by them for a year."
			</p>
			<p>
				The main consideration here is that by levying zakah on
				the rich, Allah the Exalted wants to help the poor and to
				promote the welfare of the people in general. For the
				rich, its benefit lies in cleansing their persons of
				stinginess--both in money and feelings. For the poor, its
				benefit lies in easing their circumstances. Zakah thus
				eliminates the causes of corruption which results from
				the increase of money in a few hands. It is this wisdom
				which the Qur'an refers to when it deals with the
				distribution of booty: "... that it becomes not a
				commodity between the rich among you" (al Hashr 7).
				Therefore, it is not reasonable to exempt businessmen
				from their societal obligations when they possess most of
				the nation's wealth.

		<section heading="When Goods can be Judged as Trading Goods">
			<p>
				The author of al-Mughm states that: "Merchandise can only
				be considered as trading goods for two reasons: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The actual possession of merchandise is acquired
					by an act such as a commercial transaction,
					marriage, divorce demanded by the wife (khul'),
					acceptance of a gift, bequest, booty, and other
					lawful acquisition. This is because that which is
					not subject to zakah cannot be considered as so
					subsequent to its possession on the basis of
					niyyah (intention) only, as, for example, in the
					case of fasting. It does not make any difference
					whether a person came to possess such items by
					buying them or not because his possession is by
					an act similar to inheritance. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The goods are intended, at the time of
					possession, for trade. These are considered as
					non-trade goods even though the person intends to
					use them later for trade.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				However, if he possesses these goods through inheritance
				and intends them for trade, they are not considered as
				trade goods because the determining factor in such cases
				is the status of acquisition, not the temporary state of
				trade. Mere intention will not provide a valid reason to
				change its status. For example, if a person intends to
				travel without embarking upon it, then the mere
				expression of his intention will not constitute the act
				of traveling. Likewise, if a person bought merchandise
				for trade and then intended it for possession, it would
				be considered as such and zakah will not be paid on it.

		<section heading="How is Zakah on Trade Money to be Paid">
			<p>
				One who possesses merchandise with a nisab for a year
				should pay zakah on it, the amount of which is a quarter
				of a tenth of its value. This should be done by a
				businessman every year. However, the period of a year
				does not come into effect unless his inventory
				constitutes a nisab.
			</p>
			<p>
				Assuming a businessman possesses merchandise short of a
				nisab and part of a year has passed, his inventory
				subsequently increases through an unusual rise in value
				(because of supply and demand or through price
				fluctuation) so that it constitutes a nisab; or he sold
				merchandise for the price of a nisab; or during the
				course of the year he comes to possess other merchandise
				which, together with his previous amount, completes a
				nisab; then, the hawl (for the purpose of zakah) starts
				at that time, and the time elapsed is not taken into
				consideration. This is the view of the Hanafiyyah,
				ath-Thauri, ashShaf'i, Ishaq, Abu 'Ubaid, Abu Thaur, and
				Ibn al-Mundhir.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Abu Hanifah, if the merchandise in
				possession constitutes a nisab at the beginning of the
				year and also at the end, zakah will still be applicable
				even though the nisab might have decreased within that
				time. The reason is that it is difficult to ascertain its
				completeness in the intervening period.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanbaliyyah hold that if the merchandise decreases
				during the course of the year and increases again until
				it constitutes a nisab, the (requisite) period of a year
				starts all over again because it has been interrupted in
				its course by the decrease.

				The Messenger of Allah used to say: 'There is no sadaqah

				Musa ibn Talhah says: "Five things [which were subject to

			</p>

				Commenting on the status of these reports, al-Baihaqi

			<p>
				At-Tirmidhi agrees with the preceding and says: "The

		<section heading="The Opinion of Jurists">
			<p>
				There is no difference of opinion among jurists
				concerning the obligatory nature of zakah on plants and
				fruits. They do, however, differ on the kinds of plants
				and fruits which should be subject to zakah. Here is the
				broad spectrum of opinions on the subject:
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Hasan al-Basri and ash-Shu'abi hold that zakah is only
				on the specified items (in the Qur'an and sunnah)--that
				is corn, dates, and raisins--since other kinds are not
				mentioned. Ash-Shaukani upholds this view.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah maintains that zakah is due on every type of
				produce of the land including vegetables, but excluding
				what is not intentionally planted and cultivated such as
				firewood, bamboo, grass, and those trees which bear no
				fruit. His opinion is based upon the general meaning of
				the Prophet's saying: "From what the heavens irrigate, a
				tithe [is due]." The meaning is general and encompasses
				all types of arable products, which are planted to make
				the land grow, and therefore refers to any agricultural
				practices similar to the growing of grains (habb).
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Yusuf and Muhammad hold that zakah is payable on
				every product of the land, provided it lasts the whole
				year without too much care or treatment. This includes
				produce measured by capacity, such as grains, or by mass,
				such as cotton and sugar. If the produce does not last a
				whole year, such as the two kinds of cucumber (quththa'
				and khiyar), watermelons and others of their kind, there
				is no zakah on them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malik holds that zakah is payable on that which is
				produced on the land and which stays, becomes dry, and is
				planted by human beings. This includes land produce used
				as nonperishable food (muqtat), such as safflower and
				sesame seeds. According to him, there is no zakah on
				vegetables and fruits such as figs, pomegranates and
				apples. Ash-Shaf'i maintains that zakah is payable on any
				produce, provided the resulting crop is used as regular
				food which can be stored and planted by human beings,
				such as grains and barley.
			</p>
			<p>
				An-Nawawi says: "Our opinion is that there is no zakah on
				any trees other than palm and grapevines. There is also
				no zakah on grains other than the one which is or can be
				stored, and no zakah on vegetables." Ahmad is of the
				opinion that there is zakah on everything that Allah
				causes the land to produce, such as grains and fruits,
				that can be dried, preserved, measured and planted by
				human beings, whether they be considered nonperishable
				foods, such as wheat and qutniyyat (including peas,
				beans, lentils and such other grains), or spices and
				herbs (ahariz), such as coriander, caraway seeds, or
				seeds such as linseed of the fluz plant (kittan seeds),
				the seeds of the two kinds of cucumber (quththa' and
				khiyar), or safflower and sesame seeds.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Ahmad, zakah is also payable on dry fruits
				such as dates, raisins, apricots, figs, almonds, hazel
				nuts, and pistachio nuts if the preceding specifications
				apply to them. There is no zakah on fresh fruit such as
				peaches, pears, apples, apricots, and figs. In the same
				way, it is not due on vegetables such as the two kinds of
				cucumber, watermelons, eggplants, turnips, and carrots.

		<section heading="The Origin of the Different Opinions Concerning Zakah on Plants and Fruits">
			<p>
				Of their differences on the payment of zakah pertaining
				to plants and fruits, Ibn Rushd informs us: "The
				difference of opinion lies in the fact that some jurists
				confine paying of zakah to only those items of
				consumption which are generally agreed upon, while others
				go beyond those items and include dried fruits in them
				too. [The crux of the issue is]: What qualifies the four
				edible items [wheat, barley, dates, and dried grapes] for
				zakah? Are they subject to zakah because of their being
				delineated as such or because of their special import to
				the subsistence of life? Those who subscribe to the first
				view restrict payment of zakah to the four edibles, and
				those who subscribe to the second view extend the
				obligation to all land produce except for grass,
				firewood, and bamboo. There is a consensus on the latter
				being excluded from zakah. However, when it comes to the
				use of analogy based on a general statement, both groups
				rest on shaky ground."
			</p>
			<p>
				The saying of the Prophet, which uses the expression
				alladhi yaqtadhi, reads: "From what the heavens water, a
				tithe [is due], and from what is watered by irrigation
				[nadh] a half a tithe." The relative pronoun ma is used
				to mean al-ladhi, which is a general expression. Allah,
				the Exalted, also says: "It is He who has brought into
				being gardens--both the cultivated ones and those growing
				wild--and the date palm, and fields bearing multiform
				produce, and the olive trees, and the pomegranate: all
				resembling one another and yet so different. Eat of their
				fruit when it comes to fruition, and give unto the poor
				their due on the harvest day ..." [al-An'am 141].
			</p>
			<p>
				Analogically speaking, zakah aims at counteracting
				poverty and this cannot be done through zakah on land
				produce which is edible and sustains life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Restricting a general statement with this kind of
				analogical reasoning vitiates zakah on all land produce
				except ones which sustain life. Those who follow the
				general import of the Prophet's saying add some more to
				the generally acknowledged four items. Excluded of course
				are the ones on which there is consensus.
			</p>
			<p>
				Again, those who agree upon land produce of a subsistance
				kind often differ over whether it can be considered as
				being subsistent. Can analogical reasoning be the basis
				of what they agree upon or not? An example of such a
				disagreement is that of Malik and ash-Shaf'i regarding
				olives. Malik holds that zakah on olives is obligatory,
				while ash-Shaf'i is against it, according to a latter
				view expressed in Egypt. The reason for his disagreement
				is whether olives could be considered as food vital for
				life or not.

		<section heading="Nisab of Plants and Fruits">
			<p>
				Most scholars say that there is no zakah on plants or
				fruits until they attain the amount of five awsuq.
				Furthermore, this becomes applicable only after the
				chaff, straw, and husk are removed. If it is not cleansed
				of husk, then the amount of zakah would be ten awsuq.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, said: "There is no sadaqah (zakah) on that which
				is less than five awsuq." It is also narrated by Ahmad
				and al-Baihaqi with a good chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that the Prophet, upon whom
				be peace, said: "There is no sadaqah on any amount of
				dates or grains less than five awsuq." A wusuq by
				consensus of opinion is sixty sa'as (a cubic measure of
				varying magnitude). This hadith is said to be munqati
				that is--a hadith with an interrupted chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both Abu Hanifah and Mujahid hold that zakah is due on
				any amount, little or big, in accordance with the generic
				nature of the Prophet's saying: "From what the heavens
				water, a tithe [is due] ..." This is because land produce
				is perishable and cannot be preserved for a whole year.
				In that case, such produce does not attain a nisab within
				a one-year period.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim's discussion of the subject is that the
				authentic and explicit sunnah for a tithe's nisab is the
				hadith: "From what the heavens water, a tithe [is due],
				and from what is watered by irrigation (gharb-vessel) a
				half a tithe." This is applicable to both small and large
				quantities as opposed to the specific amount mentioned in
				other hadith. In its application, a generic statement is
				as important as a specific one. Should there be a
				conflict between the two, then the most comprehensive
				will be applicable. This is the rule.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has been said that both of the preceding hadith ought
				to be followed. In their essence, they do not contradict
				each other, nor does one of them have to cancel the
				other. The Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, has to
				be obeyed in this matter, for he said: "From what the
				heavens water, a tithe [is due] . . ." This saying seeks
				to distinguish between the two (categories): one on which
				a tithe is due, and the other on which only half of the
				tithe is due. He therefore distinguished between the two
				categories only in respect to the amount due. There is no
				mention of any amount of nisab in this hadith. However,
				he mentioned it explicitly in another hadith which cannot
				be ignored as something that is general or is intended to
				be so and not otherwise. It is similar to other
				statements of general import which have been explained in
				the texts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Qudamah concludes: "The saying of the Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, that 'there is no sadaqah [zakah] on
				anything less than five awsuq' is agreed upon. This
				hadith is specific, and for this reason takes precedence
				and clarifies his previous statement of general import.
				This is similar to his saying that 'zakah is due on all
				freely grazing camels,' which becomes explicit by his
				other saying on the same subject: 'There is no sadaqah on
				less than five camels.' Likewise his saying: 'Sadaqah on
				silver is a fourth of the tithe,' becomes specific by a
				latter utterance: 'There is no sadaqah on any amount less
				than five ounces.' Thus, it is possible to have holdings
				which qualify for sadaqah per se, but on which it is not
				levied."
			</p>
			<p>
				When it comes to land produce, possession of a property
				for a year cannot be used as criterion, because their
				maturity or growth is completed by the time of harvest,
				and not by their continuity extended beyond a year.
				However, possession is considered for goods other than
				land produce since it is generally assumed that by the
				end of the year they must have completed their growth.
				The principle of attaining a nisab on any property is
				based on the understanding that a nisab is an amount
				large enough to be subjected to zakah. This may be
				explained by recalling that sadaqah is obligatory for the
				rich, which presupposes the existence of nisab generated
				by their holdings. For produce which cannot be measured
				but qualifies for zakah, a sa'a is used. One sa'a is a 
				measure equal to one and one-third cups (gadah). Thus, a
				nisab is fifty kaylah (kaylah is a dry measure of weight,
				in Egypt it is equal to 16.72 L). As to the produce which
				cannot be measured, Ibn Quadamah says: "The nisab of
				saffron, cotton and such items is to be weighed at 1,600
				Iraqi pounds (ratl, an Iraqi ratl equals approximately
				130 dirhams). Thus, its weight is estimated."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Yusuf says that if the produce cannot be measured,
				then zakah can only be levied on it when its value
				attains the nisab of articles subject to the lowest
				standard of measurement. Thus, zakah will not be levied
				on cotton until its value reaches five awsuq of an
				article to the lowest value so measured, such as barley
				and the like. This is because it is impossible to measure
				the article in itself except by the lower price of two
				nisabs. According to Muhammad ibn al-Hasan: "For zakah, a
				product has to reach five times the greatest value of its
				kind. Thus, zakah is not payable on cotton when it
				reaches five qintars, because evaluation by means of
				wusuq is based on the consideration that its value is
				higher than what is valued in kind."

		<section heading="The Rate of Zakah">
			<p>
				The rate of zakah differs according to the method of
				irrigation. If it is watered naturally without the use of
				artificial means, then the zakah payable is a tithe
				(one-tenth) of the produce. However, if it is irrigated
				by a mechanical device or with purchased water, then the
				zakah payable is half a tithe.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mu'adh reports that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				said: "On that which is watered by the heavens, or by an
				adjacent water channel, a tithe is due. As for what is
				irrigated through a well or a stream, its zakah is half a
				tithe." This hadith is narrated by alBaihaqi and
				al-Hakim, and is graded sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				said: "On that which is watered by the heavens or springs
				or its own roots, a tithe is due, and on that watered by
				a well or a stream, half a tithe." This hadith is
				narrated by al-Bukhari and others.
			</p>
			<p>
				In case the land is watered equally by artificial as well
				as natural means, then zakah payable will be
				three-fourths of a tithe.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Qudamah stated that he did not know of any difference
				of opinion on the preceding hadith. If one method of
				watering is used more than the other, then for
				calculating zakah, this would be the determining factor.
				This is the view of Abu Hanifah, Ahmad, athThauri, and
				ash-Shaf'i (one of his two opinions).
			</p>
			<p>
				All of the costs involved in harvesting, transportation,

				This is evident from their following statements reported

				off his debt, then pay zakah on the rest. Ibn 'Abbas
				said: "First he must pay off what he spent on

				Adam related this in al-Kharaj.

		<section heading="Zakah on Kharajiyyah Land">
			<p>
				Land subject to tax is divided into two categores: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					'ushriyyah land (tithe land): land owned by
					people who accepted Islam willingly or who were
					conquered by force and had their land divided
					among the conquerors, or land revived and
					cultivated by Muslims; and 
				</li>
				<li>
					kharajiyyah land (taxable land), land conquered
					by force and left to its original owners on the
					condition that they pay the required land tax.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Just as zakah is payable on 'ushriyyah, so it is paid on
				kharajiyyah when the inhabitants of the latter accept
				Islam or when a Muslim buys it. In that case, both the
				tithe and the kharaj become due, and neither of them will
				negate the application of the other.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Mundhir witnesses: "This is the view of most of
				the scholars, including 'Umar ibn 'Abdulaziz, Rabi'ah,
				az-Zuhri, Yahya al-Ansari, Malik, al-Awzai, ath-Thauri,
				al-Hasan ibn Salih, Ibn Abu Layla, al-Layth, Ibn
				al-Mubarak, Ahmad, Ishaq, Abu 'Ubaid, and Dawud." Their
				opinion is derived from the Qur'an, the sunnah, and the
				exercise of their intellect--that is, by means of
				analogical reasoning or qiyas.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Qur'anic verse referred to is: "O you who believe!
				Spend of the good things which you have earned and of
				that which We produce from the earth for you" [al-Baqarah
				267]. Sharing the produce of ones land with the poor is
				obligatory, whether the land is kharajiyyah or
				'ushriyyah. The sunnah referred to is: "From what the
				heavens water, a tithe [is due]." This hadith encompasses
				in its general meaning both the kharaj and the 'ushriyyah
				land.
			</p>
			<p>
				As to the analogical reasoning (qiyas), both zakah and
				kharaj are a kind of obligations (hagq), each based on a
				different reason, and one does not nullify the other. It
				is similar to the case when a person who is in the state
				of ihram kills privately owned game (for eating). Since
				the tithe is payable by the force of the text, it cannot
				be negated by kharaj, which becomes payable by the force
				of ijtihad. Abu Hanifah holds that there is no tithe on
				kharaj land. Kharaj, he says, is due only when the land
				is conquered, (whereas) one of the conditions governing
				the obligatory nature of the tithe is that the land
				should not be kharajiyyah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="The Validity of Abu Hanifah's View">
			<p>
				Imam Abu Hanifah provides the following evidence for his
				view: According to Ibn Mas'ud, the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, said: "Neither kharaj nor tithe ['ushr] are
				payable simultaneously on the land of a Muslim."
			</p>
			<p>
				The preceding hadith is by consensus held to be weak
				(da'if). Yahya ibn 'Anbasah reported it on the authority
				of Abu Hanifah from Hammad from Ibrahim an-Nakha'i from
				'Alqamah, from Ibn Mas'ud from the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Baihaqi probes its chain and says  in al-Ma'rifah
				as-Sunan wa al-Athar: "The preceding hadith is narrated
				by Abu Hanifah from Hammad from Ibrahim on his own
				authority. Thus, Yahya reported in suspended (marfu')
				form." Yahya ibn 'Anbasah is well-known for interpolating
				unauthentic sayings and attributing them to established
				authorities. This was related by Abu Ahmad ibn 'Adiyy
				al-Hafiz as we were informed by Abu Sa'id al-Malini about
				him."
			</p>
			<p>
				Likewise, al-Kamal Ibn al-Humam, a leading Hanafiyyah,
				considers the hadith weak.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad, Muslirn, and Abu Dawud relate from Abu Hurairah
				that the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said: "Iraq would
				refrain from paying its qafiz' and dirham, Syria its mudd
				and dinar, and Egypt its ardab and dinar. Thus, you would
				come back from where you had started." He said this three
				times. Abu Hurairah heard this in person.
			</p>
			<p>
				This hadith does not provide evidence to the effect that
				zakah should not be taken from kharaj land. The scholars
				interpret it to mean that the conversion of these
				countries to Islam would eliminate land tax. It may also
				have alluded to dissensions which could prevail at the
				end of time and which would lead to neglecting or
				fulfilling the obligation of zakah, jizyah and other such
				dues by them.
			</p>
			<p>
				An-Nawawi says: "If this hadith means what they [the
				Hanafiyyah] claim, then it means that zakah could not be
				enjoined on dirhams, dinars, and merchandise. If this is
				so, then nobody subscribes to it."
			</p>
			<p>
				It was reported that when the dahqan (grandee) of Bahr
				al-Mulk embraced Islam, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said: "Give
				him the land and collect the land tax from him." This is
				a clear statement on the matter of taking kharaj without
				demanding payment of the tithe.
			</p>
			<p>
				This incident indicates that kharaj is not cancelled for
				any person after he embraces Islam, nor does it lead to
				the cancellation of tithe. He mentioned kharaj here as a
				way of stating that it will not be cancelled by embracing
				Islam, like jizyah. As for the tithe, it is well known
				that it is binding on a free Muslim, so there is no need
				to mention it. He also did not mention the levy of zakah
				on cattle. This holds for the payment of zakah on silver
				and gold and other valuables. Perhaps the dahqan
				(grandee) did not possess anything which required the
				levy of a tithe on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is said that the practice of the rulers and imams was
				not to combine the 'ushr and kharaj. Ibn al-Mundhir
				disapproves of such a practice because 'Umar ibn
				'Abdulaziz did combine the two.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also said that kharaj is the opposite of 'ushr.
				This means that kharaj is a consequence of conquest,
				whereas 'ushr is an act of worship. Therefore, the two
				cannot be combined (at one time) and obtained
				simultaneously from the same person. This held true in
				the beginning (when lands were conquered), but it is not
				tenable in the long run. Nevertheless, not all forms of
				kharaj are based on force and conquest since some of its
				forms are instituted without force as, for example, in
				the case of lands adjoining a kharaj land or in the case
				of acquired and revived land watered with streams.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also said that the reason behind the imposition of
				kharaj and 'ushr is one--that is, an actually or
				potentially yielding land. This can be explained by
				recalling that if it is marsh land of no benefit
				(sabkhah), there is no kharaj or 'ushr on it. That is,
				one cause cannot demand two dues of the same kind. This
				is similar to the case of an individual who for a year
				possesses free-grazing camels (sa'imah) intended for
				sale, for such a person is not required to pay two kinds
				of zakah--that is, one for possession and one for trade.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is not the case because the 'ushr (tithe) is payable
				on the land's produce and the kharaj on the land itself,
				regardless of whether it is planted or not. As to the
				admissibility of the unity of cause, alKamal ibn al-Humam
				explains there is nothing to prevent two obligations from
				being connected to one cause, such as land.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most scholars are of the opinion that anyone who rents a
				piece of land and cultivates it must pay the zakah, not
				the true owner of that land. To this Abu Hanifah replies:
				"Zakah is due on the land owner." Ibn Rushd holds: "Their
				difference lies in whether the 'ushr is payable on the
				land itself or its produce." Obviously, zakah, as their
				views suggest, is payable on either of them. The
				difference is only of priority, considering that both the
				produce and the land belong to the same owner. Most
				scholars say that zakah is due on seeds (habb). Abu
				Hanifah holds that the essence of obligation rests with
				the land. Ibn Qudamah inclines toward the majority's view
				and says: "The obligation lies on the produce and is
				payable by its owner, as in the case of zakah on the
				value [of a property] intended for trade. Also, it is
				similar to the tithe payable on the produce of the land
				owned." Their (the Hanafiyyah) view is not authentic, for
				if zakah were to be levied on the value of the land, then
				it would have been obligatory even if the land was not
				cultivated, as is the case with the land tax, and even
				nonMuslirns would not be excluded from its application.
				Be that the case, kharaj would have to be estimated on
				the land itself, not on the value of produce--that is, it
				would be considered part of the expenditure of fay', not
				the expenditure of zakah.

			<p>
				As soon as palm trees and grapevines ripen and their
				produce is ready to be picked, an estimation of their
				nisab is made without their actual weighing. The process
				is carried out by a knowledgeable and trustworthy person
				who estimates the amount of fresh grapes and dates still
				on the trees for zakah as if they were dry dates and
				raisins. The arnount of zakah is, however, payable when
				the fruit becomes dry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Humayd as-Sa'idi related: "We went on the expedition
				of Tabuk with the Prophet, upon whom be peace. When we
				arrived at Wadi al-Qura, we saw a woman in her orchard.
				The Prophet said: 'Let us estimate [her zakah].' Then the
				Messenger, upon whom be peace, estimated ten awsuq and
				told her: '[The amount of zakah] has been calculated on
				your [orchard's] produce.' " This is narrated by
				alBukhari.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the practice of the Messenger of Allah, upon whom
				be peace, and his companions and the scholars observed
				it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafiyyah have different views because they consider
				conjecture to be uncertain, and therefore, of no use in
				determining the amount owed. Still, the tradition of the
				Messenger of Allah is a better guide ('adha) because
				conjecture is not guessing; it is a diligent attempt to
				estimate the amount of the produce. It is the same as
				estimating the amount of the produce lost (because of its
				being rotten or moth-ridden). The basis for conjecture
				rests on the custom that people eat fresh fruits, and as
				such, there is no need for calculating the amount of
				zakah before it is eaten or plucked. In this way, the
				owners are allowed to do what they want and, at the same
				time, to determine the amount of zakah. The appraiser
				should ignore a third or a fourth of the produce as a
				reprieve for the property owners since they, their
				guests, and their neighbors need to eat some of it. Also,
				the produce is exposed to such perils as birds feeding,
				passers-by plucking, and wind blowing. Any appraisal of
				the amount of zakah on all of the produce without
				excluding a third or a fourth of it (for the preceding
				reasons) would have militated against the genuine
				interests of the owners.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sahl ibn Abu Hathamah related that the Prophet, upon whom
				be peace, said: "Whenever you conjecture, estimate the
				[zakah] and ignore one-third. If you do not, then leave
				[at least] one-fourth." This is narrated by Ahmad and the
				authors of Sunan, except for Ibn Majah. It was also
				reported by al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban, and they both
				authenticated it. Commenting on the status of the report,
				atTirmidhi says: "The hadith reported by Sahl is the one
				enacted or followed by most scholars." Bashir ibn Yassar
				said: "When 'Umar ibn al-Khattab appointed Abu Hathamah
				al-Ansari to estimate the property of Muslims, he told
				him: 'Whenever you see that the people have left some
				dates unplucked for autumn, leave them for the people to
				eat, and do not estimate the zakah on them.' "
			</p>
			<p>
				Makhul said: "Whenever the Messenger of Allah, upon whom
				be peace, assigned someone to estimate, he would say: 'Be
				easy on the people, for some of their property [trees]
				could be barren, some low, and some for [their] eating.'
				" It was narrated by Abu 'Ubaid, who added: "The low palm
				tree is called as-sabilah and allows its fruit to be
				plucked by passers-by. The eating tree (al-akilah) is a
				palm tree especially designated as an eating tree for the
				owner's family or for whoever is attached to them."

				It is permissible for the owner to eat from the grain,

			</p>

			</p>
			<p>
				Scholars have different points of view in regard to

				Allah, the Exalted One, commanded those paying zakah to

				forbade paying it from the bad portion. He says: "O you
				who believe! Spend of the good things you have earned and
				from that which We bring forth from the earth for you,

				While mentioning this verse, al-Bara' said: "This was

				Most scholars say that there is no zakah on honey.
				AlBukhari, for one, states: "There is no authentic
				tradition concerning zakah on honey." Ash-Shaf'i
				explains: "In my view, no zakah is levied on it because
				there is no evidence in the traditions (sunan and 'athar)
				for doing so. Thus, it was exempted." Ibn al-Mundhir
				affirms: "There is no tradition (khabar) which states

				consensus. Therefore, there is no zakah on honey. This is
				the opinion of most scholars."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafiyyah and Ahmad are of the opinion that honey is
				subject to zakah, even though there is no evidence for
				this view in any tradition, except for some traditions
				('athar) which support each other. Their reason is that
				since it is produced from blossoms, trees, and flowers
				and weighed and stored like other types of produce, zakah
				is due on it. They also say it is subject to zakah
				because the cost of producing it is less than the cost of
				growing fruits and plants. Abu Hanifah made it a
				condition that when zakah is due on honey, it should only
				be collected on honey produced on tithe land. However, he
				did not stipulate any nisab for it. If this is so, then
				reason dictates that it should be a tithe due on any
				amount. Imam Ahmad, on the contrary, stipulated that it
				should attain a nisab equal to ten 'afraq. One faraq
				equals sixteen Iraqi pounds. It makes no difference

			</p>
			<p>
				When they are ten, their zakah is two sheep. Thus, every
				time they increase by five, the zakah due on them is one
				more sheep. However, when they reach twenty-five, the due
				zakah is a she-camel (bint makhad or bint labun) which is
				a year old and starting the second, or a young male camel
				which is two years and already starting the third year.
				When they reach thirty-six, the zakah due on them is a
				young she-camel (bint labun). When they reach forty-six,
				the due zakah is a she-camel (huqqah) which is already
				three years old and starting the fourth. When they reach
				sixty-one, the due zakah is a four year old camel already
				starting its fifth year (jadh'ah). When they reach
				seventy-six, two young she-camels (bint labun) are due.
				When they are in the range of ninety-one to 120, the
				zakah is two young camels (huqqatan). When the number of
				camels is above 120, on every forty young she-camels, one
				bint labun is due. And on every fifty above 120, a young
				she-camel (huqqah) is due.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the ages of camels offered for zakah differ, the
				owner should pay jadh'ah. If he does not have it, he may
				pay huqqah and may add two sheep or twenty dirhams
				provided he can afford to. The person who has to pay
				huqqah as zakah but does not have it only has to pay
				jadh'ah. The zakah collector, then, will pay him the
				difference, which is twenty dirhams or two female sheep.
				The one who has to pay huqqah and does not possess it can
				pay just the bint labun if he has it, along with two
				sheep if they are available. If not, he may pay twenty
				dirhams. If he has to pay the zakah of bint labun and
				does not have it, he can pay a huqqah and will receive
				from the zakah collector twenty dirhams or two sheep. If
				he has to pay the zakah of bint labun but has only bint
				makhad, it will be accepted from him along with two sheep
				if they are available, or twenty dirhams. If he is liable
				for the zakah of bint makhad and does not possess it, a
				ibn labun will be accepted from him without any
				additional things. If he has only four camels, he is not
				supposed to pay anything unless he wants to.

				Sheep are subject to zakah when their number reaches

				Definition of Awqas: Awqas is a plural form of waqs. A
				waqs is any amount or number that lies between the
				regulation of the lower ordinance and that of a higher
				one. Scholars agree that such a waqs is exempt from
				zakah. It has been confirmed in the sayings of the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, concerning the sadaqah of
				camels that he said: "When the number of camels reaches
				twenty-five, a young she-camel one year old and already
				starting the second (ibn makhad); when they reach
				thirty-six to forty-five, then the zakah due on them is a
				young she-camel two years old and already starting the
				third (bint labun)." Concerning the sadaqah of cattle, he
				said: "When cattle number between thirty and forty, the
				zakah is a young calf of one year old (tabi') or a bull
				or cow of one year and already starting the second (jadh'
				or jadh'ah); when they reach forty, a young cow of two
				years old and already starting the third (rnusinnah)."
				Concerning sadaqah on sheep, he said: "When the number of
				freely grazing sheep is between forty-two and 120, their
				zakah is one ewe." Thus, what lies between twenty-five
				and thirty-six camels is considered waqs--that is, there
				is no zakah on them. Likewise, what lies between thirty
				and forty cattle is considered waqs. This is also applies
				to sheep.

				When a person has a nisab of camels, cattle, and lambs,
				and they give birth during the same year, zakah is due on
				both the original number and their offsprings at the end
				of the year. Their zakah is considered a lump-sum zakah
				according to the majority of scholars. On the authority

				ath-Thaqafi, it is related that 'Umar ibn al-Khattab
				said: "The new-born sheep (as-sakhlah) carried by the

				the average quality of the property."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah, ash-Shaf'i, and Abu Thaur are of the opinion
				that the young offspring are not to be calculated in the
				zakah payment unless the mature animals make a nisab.
				Also, Abu Hanifah stated that the young sheep can be
				added to fulfill a nisab whether they are born from the
				same livestock or not. They will be subject to zakah at
				the end of the year. Ash-Shaf'i lays down the condition
				that young animals have to be born prior to the
				completion of the nisab. There is no zakah on young
				animals according to Abu Hanifah, Muhammad, Dawud,
				ash-Shu'abi, and Ahmad.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad, Abu Dawud, an-Nasa'i, ad-Daraqutni and al-Baihaqi,

					the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, came
					to us and I heard him say: 'We do not collect
					zakah on suckling animals, nor do we separate
					between them [young and old], nor combine them
					together.' A man came with a great humped camel
					(kawma), but he did not accept it as zakah." It
					was reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and anNasa'i.
				</li>
				<li>
					Anas reported that Abu Bakr wrote to him: "These
					are the sadaqah stipulations which the Messenger
					of Allah, upon whom be peace, made obligatory to
					the Muslims. [And of it] do not combine. There is
					no need to gather [young and old] animals nor to
					separate them to obtain the correct sadaqah
					amount. What happens to a mixture of young and
					old? When zakah is assessed on two associates,
					then they have to figure it out equally among
					them." AlBukhari relates this.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Malik, in alMuwatta', says: "There are, for example,
				three partners, each having forty sheep on which zakah is
				payable. If they add their sheep together, their zakah
				will be only one sheep. Or, another example: two partners
				have 201 sheep. Their zakah will be three sheep. If they
				divide the flock among them, their zakah will be one
				sheep each."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaf'i holds that this statement is addressed to both
				the owner and the zakah collector. Each is ordered not to
				add or separate his possessions to obtain a lower or
				higher sadaqah. Since the owner would naturally prefer a
				low sadaqah on his property, he would combine or separate
				his possessions accordingly. The same would also be true
				of the zakah collector, who might like to collect as much
				sadaqah as possible. By using the phrase khashyat
				assadaqah (for fear of sadagah), the Prophet meant that
				it may become more or less since both altematives were
				possible. This shows that he did not prefer one choice
				over the other. Therefore, he made both altematives
				possible. According to the Hanafiyyah: "This is, in a
				sense, a prohibition on the zakah collector's separating
				the property of a person so that his sadaqah is not
				increased. For example: a man possesses 120 sheep. If
				they are divided into three lots of forty each, the zakah
				would amount to three sheep. Another example: if they
				combine the property of one man with the property of
				another, the sadaqah would increase. Thus, if a person
				owns 101 sheep and another owns an equal number, then the
				zakah collector, if he combines the two lots, would
				secure three sheep as payment toward zakah, while the
				actual amount due is only two sheep."

		<section heading="Does Combining (Animals) Have any Effect?">
			<p>
				The Hanafiyyah hold that as far as the determination of
				zakah is concemed, combining (animals) has no effect.
				Whether such a combination is between partners or has
				ensued because of contiguity does not matter. There will
				be no zakah on the joint ownership of partners unless
				each of them attains a nisab. The consensus is that zakah
				has to be detemlined on the basis of sole ownership.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Malikiyyah maintain that ownership of cattle is
				considered as one for the purpose of zakah. The
				combination becomes valid only for zakah when the
				co-owners in their own right possess a nisab. In addition
				to this, they should have a common herdsman, a common
				breed, a common pen, and the expressed intention of
				having joint ownership. If the herd of one of them is
				distinguished from the other, they will be considered two
				separate entities. In that case, each individual becomes
				liable for zakah. The combination affects livestock. What
				is taken as zakah from the herd will be distributed among
				the partners in accordance with each one's share. If the
				property of one of the associates is separate, then all
				of it is considered combined.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the Shaf'iyyah, every share of the
				combination affects the zakah and the zakah on two or
				more associates' separate properties becomes due. This
				may affect the amount of zakah due; for example, if two
				men, each possessing twenty sheep, combine their sheep,
				the zakah due is one, but if they do not combine them,
				then there is no zakah on either one. On the other hand,
				a combination of 101 sheep with the same number results
				in a zakah of one and one-half sheep. However, if the
				flocks of sheep are considered separately, then the zakah
				due on each lot is only one sheep. As for the case of
				three associates, each of them having forty sheep, if
				they combine them, the zakah due is one sheep--that is,
				the zakah due for each partner is one-third of a sheep.
				However, if treated separately, each should pay one
				sheep. In addition to this, the Shaf'iyyah moreover
				stipulate the following:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The partners should qualify financially to pay
					zakah. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The combined property must attain a nisab. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Its zakah is due at the end of the year. 
				</li>
				<li>
					None of the properties is singled out from the
					others as regards resting pen, grazing area,
					watering, herdsmen, and milking sheds. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Flocks of the same kind are bred by the same ram.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Ahmad agrees with the Shaf'iyyah, except that he limited
				the effect of combination to cattle and does not take
				into consideration any other properties.

				The term rikaz is etymologically derived from rakaza, the

				men and believing women gardens of Eden" [at-Taubah 72]
				since it is an abode for eternity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scholars differ about minerals (ma'din) which are subject
				to zakah. Ahmad holds that everything dug from the
				ground, whether created in it or buried by man, and which
				has a value (such as gold, silver, iron, copper, lead,
				sapphires, chrysolite, emeralds, turquoise, crystal,
				agate, kohl (antimony sulfide), arsenic, tar, petroleum,
				sulphur, zaj) are subject to zakah. He, however, made it
				a condition that the extracted mineral should attain a
				nisab either by itself or by its value. Abu Hanifah is of
				the opinion that zakah is payable on any mineral that can
				receive an imprint or melt by fire, such as gold, silver,
				iron, or copper. As for liquids such as tar, or a solid
				mineral which cannot be melted by fire such as rubies,
				there is no zakah on them. In the former case, the

				Malik and ash-Shaf'i hold that both gold and silver

				4.68 g.) and the silver at least 200 dirhams. They agree
				(with the Hanafiyyah) that these metals do not require

				That zakah of rikaz and ma'din is obligatory is shown by
				a statement attributed to Abu Hurairah: "The Prophet,
				upon whom be peace, said: 'There is no compensation for
				one killed or wounded by an animal, falling in a well, or
				because of working in mines; but, one-fifth (khums) is
				compulsory on rikaz.' " Ibn al-Mundhir confesses that he
				does not know anyone who contradicted this hadith except
				al-Hasan, who differentiates between what exists in the
				land of war and the Islamic land. The latter holds that
				if rikaz is found in the land of war, one-fifth (khums)
				is due, but if it is found in the Islamic land, it will
				be subject to the regular zakah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Explaining it, Ibn al-Qayyim says that there are two
				interpretations of this statement:
			</p>
			<p>
				The first interpretation is that whenever someone hires
				someone else to dig a mine for him and then he falls into
				it and is killed, there is no compensation for him. This
				view is supported by the Prophet's saying: "There is no
				compensation for one who falls into a well or who is
				killed by an animal--(al-bi'r jubar, wa al-'ajma'
				jubar)."
			</p>
			<p>
				The second interpretation is that there is no zakah on
				minerals. This view is supported by the Prophet's saying:
				"... but one-fifth is compuslory on treasure--(wa fi
				az-zakah al-khums)." Thus, he differentiated between
				mineral (ma'din) and treasure (rikaz). He made zakah on
				rikaz compulsory because it is a wealth obtained without
				any cost or effort. He exempted minerals (ma'din) from
				zakah because they require both cost and effort for their
				mining.

			<ol>
				<li>
					In a barren land, a land of unknown ownership, or
					in an intractible road, or ruined village. In
					that case, khums has to be paid, and the one who
					found it may keep the other four-fifths for
					himself. This is based on a report from an-Nasa'i
					on the authority of 'Amr ibn Shu'aib from his
					father and from his grandfather, who said that
					when the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace,
					was asked about a lucky find (al-luqatah), he
					responded: "For anything along a tractable road
					or in an inhabited village, its ownership is
					determined by established custom. If the owner
					claims it, it is his. However, when an item is
					found in an intractable road or in an uninhabited
					village, then on it and the rest of the find,
					one-fifth (khums) is payable."
				</li>
				<li>
					If the rikaz is found by someone in a land
					transferred to him, then it is his, as it is
					lodged in the land. Nevertheless, his ownership
					does not come from his possession of the land--it
					comes from the fact that it became known to him.
					Analogically, this kind of find falls into the
					category of grass, firewood, and game which are
					found on land which is not his. He can claim it
					if the one who transferred the land does not ask
					for it. In that case, it will be his because the
					land originally belonged to him. This is the view
					of Abu Yusuf, and the Hanbaliyyah uphold it as
					sound. Ash-Shaf'i says it belongs to the owner
					who transferred the land (if he claims it) before
					him, and so on until it is claimed by the first
					original owner.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Whenever land is transferred through inheritance, it is
				considered an inheritance by itself. If, however, the
				inhabitants agree that it did not belong to the one from
				whom they inherited it, then it belongs to the original
				owner. If he is unknown, then it is considered the lost

			<p>
				When a person acquires property and it stays in his
				possession for a year and constitutes a nisab, and he has
				no other property or he has similar property which has
				not reached a nisab except when the acquired property has
				been added to it, then the year hawl of zakah becomes
				applicable to it from the time of its acquisition. The
				zakah will be payable at the completion of the hawl. In
				such a case, the acquired property may be classified in
				any of the following categories:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The acquired holdings increase in value either by
					profits from trade or by an increase in animal
					production. These kinds of holdings qualify
					themselves for the application of the hawl and
					zakah. For the individual whose merchandise or
					animals constitute a nisab and whose business
					also makes a profit or whose animals reproduce
					during the course of the hawl, he should count
					the original and additional property as one for
					the purpose of zakah. There is no dispute about
					this among scholars.
				</li>
				<li>
					As for the acquired property which falls under
					the same category as the attained nisab but is
					not derived or generated from it--that is, it was
					acquired through purchase, gift, or inheritance--
					Abu Hanifah holds that this may be combined with
					the nisab in order to become a part of it with
					regard to the hawl and payment of zakah. Thus,
					the principal property and the profits are
					collectively taxable.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaf'i and Ahmad suggest that newly acquired property
				be combined with the original one for the purpose of
				attaining a nisab and that a new hawl has to be assumed
				for it--whether the original consists of cash or animals.
				For example, if someone has 200 dirhams and manages to
				acquire another 200 dirhams during the year, he should
				pay zakah on both at the completion of the hawl which
				will begin to roll at the acquisition of new property.
				Malik's opinion is like that of Abu Hanifah's concerning
				animals but like Ahmad's in regard to gold and silver.

		<section heading="Zakah ie the Responsibility of the Owner, Not the Holdings Themselves">
			<p>
				The Hanafiyyah, the Malikiyyah, and a report from
				ash-Shaf'i and Ahmad propose that it is the property
				which owes zakah. The second opinion attributed to
				ash-Shaf'i and Ahmad is that zakah is the responsibility
				of the owner, not the property. The difference between
				the two opinions is obvious:
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, someone had 200 dirhams and did not pay
				zakah on the sum for two years. The opinion which says
				that zakah is due on the property itself means that the
				amount due is for one year only since it decreased by
				five dirhams, which was the amount due for zakah at the
				end of the first year. The second opinion, that zakah is
				the responsibility of the owner, means that he should pay
				zakah twice, one for each year, as zakah is the
				responsibility of the owner and is not affected by the
				decrease of the nisab.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Hazm favors the view that it is the owner's
				responsibility. There has been no difference of opinion,
				he says, among the Muslims since the time of the Prophet,
				upon whom be peace, down to his time as to the
				applicability of zakah on wheat, barley, dates, silver,
				gold, camels, cattle, and sheep. Concerning payment of
				zakah from a different lot of wheat, barley, dates, gold,
				silver, camels, cattle, and sheep, he says it does not
				matter whether one pays it from the same lot, from a
				different one in one's possession, or from a lot that may
				be bought, granted as a gift, or borrowed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The conviction that the payment of zakah is the owner's
				responsibility and is not necessarily that of the
				property itself is a sound principle, for if it becomes
				due on the property itself, the owner will not be
				permitted to make payment from a different lot. It is
				similar to the case of one partner being prevented from
				giving his money to his copartner from a source other
				than the one involved in their partnership--unless the
				partners approve of it and it does not violate the
				conditions of the transaction between them. Furthermore,
				if zakah has to be applied to the property itself, only
				two situations can arise. First, zakah is payable on all
				parts of that property and is applicable to any
				individual amount of it, without individual
				specification. Second, if it is applicable to every part
				of it, it is impermissible to sell from any herd or grain
				since zakah collectors in this case would become
				partners. Thus, the proprietor is not allowed to take
				anything from it. This is void without any dispute.
				Furthermore, it would become obligatory upon him to
				specify exactly the price of the sheep which he desires
				to take out, just as is done in partnerships. If zakah is
				due on any part of it other than the property itself, it
				becomes void. This holds true in such a case since he
				does not know what he might sell or whether he is taking
				what is due for the sadaqah collectors. This, in turn,
				backs up the above.

		<section heading="Loss of the Holdings after Zakah is Due">
			<p>
				Once zakah becomes payable on the holdings either because
				of the completion of a year or harvest time, and the
				holdings or part of them are lost, the owner still has to
				pay it. Whether the loss occured owing to negligence or
				not does not matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the opinion of Ibn Hazm and the better opinion of
				the Hanbaliyyah. Abu Hanifah holds that it vitiates the
				payment of zakah if all the property perishes without the
				owner's role in its destruction. When part of it
				perishes, the perished portion is not subject to zakah.
				This is in accordance with the rule that zakah is
				associated with the property itself. However, when the
				property is deliberately destroyed by the owner, zakah
				has to be paid. Ash-Shaf'i, alHassan ibn Salih, Ishaq,
				Abu Thaur, and Ibn al-Mundhir hold that if the nisab
				perishes before zakah is paid, then the owner owes
				nothing. However, if it perishes subsequent to the
				accumulation of the nisab, the owner has to pay it. Ibn
				Qudamah supports this view and says it vitiates the
				payment of zakah if the property perishes without any
				negligence on the part of the owner. This is because it
				is obligatory for the sake of beneficence, which
				presupposes the existence of the property--and not with
				the purpose of impoverishing the payers of zakah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Negligence in this context implies that the owner had
				accumulated the nisab and thus it was possible for him to
				pay zakah, but he did not and the property perished. On
				the contrary, if he did not have the nisab, or the
				holdings were not in his possession, or they were to be
				purchased and he could not, then this does not constitute
				an act of negligence.
			</p>
			<p>
				Likewise, if it is presumed that the obligation to pay
				zakah remains even after the holdings are lost, and the
				owner has the means to pay it, then he must do so.
				Otherwise, he should be granted a respite in order to
				fulfill his obligation to pay zakah. This is akin to a
				debt one owes to someone but the debt owed to Allah
				should be considered more important.

				'Ubaid is that whoever possesses a nisab of any kind of
				property and then sells it before the completion of the
				year hawl, or gives it away as a gift, or damages part of
				it with the intention of avoiding its zakah, he still
				must pay its zakah. If he engages himself in any of the

				however, any of the preceding acts happen at the
				beginning of the hawl, this will not constitute an

			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah and ash-Shaf'i hold that since the amount
				decreased before the end of the hawl, zakah will not be

				they would pluck its fruit the next morning, and made no

				Zakah, as such, will still be due and the person has to

				There are eight categories of the beneficiaries of zakah
				which Allah specifies in the Qur'an: "The alms are only
				for the poor and the needy, for those who collect them,
				for those whose hearts are to be reconciled, for the
				freedom of those who are captives and in debt, for the
				cause of Allah, and for the wayfarers; [it is] a duty
				imposed by Allah. Allah is the Knower, the Wise"
				[at-Taubah 60]. Ziyad ibn alHarith as-Suda'i reported: "I
				came to the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, and
				pledged allegience to him. Then a man came and said to
				the Messenger: 'Give me some of the collected sadaqah.'
				The Messenger replied: 'Allah did not leave the matter of
				sadaqat to be decided by a prophet nor to others ... He
				Himself classified it into eight categories. If you fit
				into any of these categories, I will give you your due.'
				" It was narrated by Abu Dawud although in its chain of
				transmission there is 'Abdurrahman al-'Afriqi, who is of
				questionable merits.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following is an elaboration upon the preceding eight
				categories:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The Poor (al-Fuqara').
				</li>
				<li>
					The Needy (al-Masakin): The needy, along with the
					poor mentioned above, are those who do not even
					have basic needs fulfilled. This categroy
					parallels the category of the rich who have all
					they need. As mentioned elsewhere, a person is
					considered rich if he possesses the nisab--that
					is, an arnount in excess of his essential needs
					or those of his children with regard to food,
					drink, clothing, housing, animals, tools of his
					trade, and similar other necessities. Thus, one
					who lacks all these is considered poor (fuqura')
					and qualifies for zakah.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				A hadith attributed to Mu'adh instructs: "Take from the
				rich [that is those who are self-sufficient] and give to
				their poor." Thus, zakah should be taken from the rich
				who own a nisab and given to those who are not so
				fortunate.
			</p>
			<p>
				No difference has been made here between the poor
				(fuqura') and the needy (nasakin) as far as their needs,
				their poverty, and their qualification for receiving
				zakah are concerned. The two are brought together in the
				preceding Qur'anic 'ayah with the necessary conjunction
				so that they could be differentiated from each other.
				This does not contradict our categorizing the masakin as
				a subgroup of the fuqura'. In the following hadith, the
				text indicates that the needy are the poor who are not
				noticed by the people because they abstain from begging.
				The Qur'an takes note of them because they, perhaps due
				to their modesty, go unnoticed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah, upon
				whom be peace, said: "The needy person (miskin) is not
				one who goes around asking the people for a date or two,
				or for a mouthful or two, but the one who is too
				embarrassed to ask. Read if you wish: 'They do not beg
				from men importunately' [alBaqarah 273]." In a variant of
				this report, it is related: "The needy person is not one
				who goes around asking people for a mouthful or two or a
				date or two, but the one who has not enough [money] to
				satisfy his needs and whose condition is not known to
				others. Thus, sadaqah is given to him and he does not beg
				from the people." This is narrated by al-Bukhari and
				Muslim.

				AlMustawrid ibn Shaddad relates that the Prophet, upon

				and has no house, let him have a house; if he has no
				wife, let him have a wife; if he has no servant, let him
				have a servant; or if he has no mount to ride, let him
				have one. He who clamors for anything other than these is
				being excessive." This is related by Ahmad and Abu Dawud
				and its chain is sound. Commenting on the subject,
				al-Khattabi says: "This may be interpreted in two
				different ways. The first means that the individual is
				permitted to have a servant or a house deducted from his
				wages, which are similar to any other wages. He is not
				permitted to take anything else. The second means that
				the zakah worker has the right to have lodging and a
				servant. Thus, if he does not have a house or a servant,
				one may be hired to serve him and a house may be rented
				for him during the tenure of his job."

			<p>
				As for the unbelievers, they are of two categories:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Those who may come to Islam through the
					reconciliation of their hearts: Such was the case
					of Safwan ibn 'Umayyah whom the Prophet, upon
					whom be peace, granted safety on the day of
					Makkah's conquest. The Prophet, upon whom be
					peace, allowed him to think about his situation
					for four months and then choose for himself. He
					was absent at the time but came forward later and
					went with the Muslims to fight in the battle of
					Hunayn before his acceptance of Islam. The
					Prophet, upon whom be peace, borrowed his armory
					for the expedition of Hunayn, and in return gave
					him a large number of camels, loaded with goods,
					that were at a certain valley. Thereupon Safwwan
					said: "This is a gift from someone who does not
					fear poverty. By Allah," he continued, "the
					Prophet, upon whom be peace, has given all of
					this to me and verily he is the person whom I
					dislike the most, but he continued to give me
					things until he became the one I loved the most."
				</li>
				<li>
					People whose evil is feared, and it is hoped that
					money, if given to them, will neutralize their
					hostility: Ibn 'Abbas reported: "A group of
					people used to come to the Prophet, upon whom be
					peace. If he gave them money, they would praise
					Islam and say: 'This is a good religion.'
					However, if he did not give them any money, they
					criticized and found fault with Islam." Among
					such people were Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, al-Aqra'
					ibn Habis, and 'Uyainah ibn Hisn. The Prophet,
					upon whom be peace, gave every one of them one
					hundred camels.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The Hanafiyyah say that the share of such people are
				cancelled when Islam is strong. For instance, 'Uyainah
				ibn Hisn, al-Aqra' ibn Habis, and al-'Abbas ibn Mirdas
				came to Abu Bakr and requested their share. He wrote them
				a letter, which they took to 'Umar. He tore the letter
				and said: "This is something that the Prophet, upon whom
				be peace, used to give you to reconcile you to Islam.
				Now, Allah has fortified Islam and it is no longer in
				need of you. Unless you stay with Islam, the sword will
				be between you and us. Say: 'It is the truth from the
				Lord of you [all]. Then whoever will, let him believe,
				and whoever will, let him disbelieve' [al Kahf 29]." They
				returned to Abu Bakr and said: "Are you the Caliph or is
				'Umar? You wrote a letter for us and 'Umar tore it up."
				He answered: "This is the way it is."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafiyyah continue: "Indeed, Abu Bakr agreed with
				'Umar, and none of the companions disapproved of it.
				Likewise, it was never reported from 'Uthman or 'Ali that
				they gave anything to anyone in this category."
			</p>
			<p>
				It can be answered that the case under reference was
				'Umar's own judgment. He saw that there would be no
				benefit in mollifying these people after Islam had become
				well-established among their people, and no harm would
				follow if they abandoned Islam. Also, if 'Uthman and 'Ali
				stopped spending this kind of endowment, this does not
				necessarily mean that the provision for it was repealed.
				It is possible that the change of circumstances did not
				call for the continuation of such an endowment to the
				nonbelievers. However, this does not amount to the
				invalidation of the provision for such endowments. Should
				the contingency call for its revival, the endowments in
				this category can be given. This is because their
				sanction lies in the Qur'an and sunnah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad and Muslim reported from Anas that whenever the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, was asked for anything for
				the sake of Islam, he would give it away. A man came and
				asked for sadaqah. The Prophet ordered that the man be
				given the entire lot of sheep between two mountains.
				These sheep were part of the sadaqah. The man returned to
				his people and said: "Oh my people! Accept Islam, for
				indeed, Muhammad gives in such a way as if he does not
				fear poverty." Ash-Shaukani says that al-'Itrah,
				al-Jobbani, al-Balkhi, and Ibn Mubashshir held that
				sadaqah may be given to those whose hearts are to be
				reconciled to Islam. On the contrary, ash-Shaf'i
				maintains that such endowments are not for unbelievers.
				As for the sinner (faszq), he may be given from such
				allocations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah and his followers hold that this kind of
				endowment was cancelled with the spread and domination of
				Islam and, as evidence, they cite Abu Bakr's refusal to
				restore endowments to Abu Sufyan, 'Uyainah, al-Aqra', and
				al-'Abbas ibn Mirdas. It appears that reconciliation is
				permitted when the need for it arises. In other words, it
				is permitted to give them sadaqah for reconciliation when
				a people obey a leader only for worldly affairs, and they
				cannot be controlled except by force and domination. The
				spread of Islam has no ramification on the issue of
				reconciliation because it makes no difference in this
				case. The author of al-Manar testifies: "This is the
				whole truth. Only independent judgment can be exercised
				to elaborate on the eligibility and the amount of sadaqah
				or booty to be given away when they are available, along
				with other kinds of property [immovable and movable]. It
				is necessary to seek consultation of capable people (ahl
				ashShura) as the caliphs did in those matters that
				required ijtihad. Whether a leader can force them into
				obedience by coercive action before resorting to the use
				of the endowment is an unsettled issue. Nevertheless,
				this cannot be followed as a rule but rather as the
				principle of inclining to the lesser of two evils and to
				the best benefit of the society."

		<section heading="Freeing Captives">
			<p>
				This category includes two kinds of slaves: contracted
				slaves (rnukazabun) and regular slaves. Both categories
				were aided with sadaqah to obtain their freedom. Al-Bara'
				reported: "A man came to the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				and said to him: 'Guide me to a deed that makes me close
				to Heaven and far from Hell.' The Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, said: 'Free a person and redeem a slave.' " Then
				al-Bara' asked: "O Messenger of Allah. Are not the two
				the same?" He answered: "No. Freeing a person is to grant
				him freedom [by redeeming him from his bondage], but the
				redeeming of the neck means buying him his freedom." This
				is related by Ahmad and ad-Daraqutni and their report is
				trustworthy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, said: "Three persons have the right to be helped
				by Allah: the warrior (ghazi) who fights for Allah, the
				contracted slave who longs to buy his freedom, and one
				who wishes to get married for the sake of chastity." This
				is related by Ahmad and the ashab as-Sunan. At-Tirmidhi
				grades this report as good and sound.
			</p>
			<p>
				As to the meaning of free captives (wa fi ar-riqab),
				ash-Shaukani says that scholars differ over it. 'Ali ibn
				Abu Talib, Sa'id ibn Jubair, al-Layth, ath-Thauri,
				al-'Itrah, the Hanafiyyah, the Shaf'iyyah, and the
				majority of scholars are reported to believe that it
				refers to contracted slaves (rnukatabdn) whose freedom is
				secured through payment from zakah. According to Ibn
				'Abbas, al-Hasan al-Basri, Malik, Ahrnad ibn Hanbal, Abu
				Thaur, and Abu 'Ubaid, it means using zakah in the
				release of any kind of slave. Al-Bukhari and Ibn
				al-Mundhir are also supportive of this view. Their
				rationale is that the expression wa fi ar-riqab cannot be
				confined to the kind of slavery arising from a contract
				because, if that had been the case, then it would have
				fallen under the category of those in debt (gharimln),
				for theirs is an obvious case of debt. As such, freeing a
				slave from bondage is better than helping a contracted
				slave. He could be aided or helped, but not freed, for
				the contracted slave is a slave as long as he owes even
				one dirham. At the same time, freeing a slave is possible
				at any time, in contrast to the situation of a contracted
				slave.
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on the subject, az-Zuhri says that the
				preceding position entails two possibilities. The
				Qur'anic 'ayah on the subject alludes to these two
				possibilities, which have been pointed out by ashShaukani
				in his Muntaqa al-Akhbar. In the hadith narrated by
				alBara', evidence suggests that redeeming necks is not
				the same as freeing them. Nor is the deed of freeing
				slaves the same as helping contracted ones with money to
				pay off the contract. Both of these bring the individual
				closer to Heaven and distance him from Hell.

				People burdened by debts and unable to pay them are of
				several kinds: those who took upon themselves
				responsibility to discharge a debt; those who guaranteed
				debts of others and therefore, upon default, the debts
				have become their obligation; those who mismanaged their
				finances, those who borrowed money because they had to;
				or those who were involved in sinful acts and then
				repented, and who had to pay a fine for repentance. All
				of them may take sadaqah to meet their debts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anas reported that the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said:
				"Asking for sadaqah is permissible only for the following
				three classes [of people]: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					those who are in abject poverty, 
				</li>
				<li>
					those who have severe debts, or 
				</li>
				<li>
					those who incurred it in the payment of blood
					money [on behalf of a relative or friend]." This
					is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and
					at-Tirmidhi. The latter grades it hasn.

			</ol>
			<p>
				Muslim relates from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that a man made a
				bad deal on fruit and then ran into heavy debt. The
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, recommended: "Give him
				sadaqah." Then the people gave him sadaqah. However, he
				still had some debt left over. Thereupon, the Prophet,
				upon whom be peace, said to creditors: "Take what you get
				. . ."
			</p>
			<p>
				As to the previously stated hadith of Qabisah ibn
				Mukhariq, in which he says: "I had a debt. I went to the
				Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, and asked him for
				help. He answered: 'Wait until we have received funds for
				sadaqah, then we will give some to you.' " The expression
				hamalah in this hadith, as defined by the scholars, is to
				assume someone's responsibility as one's own in order to
				restitute a discord. In pre-Islamic times, whenever
				strife took place among the Arab tribes and blood was
				spilled, compensation was called for. In such a case, one
				of them would volunteer to meet the obligation until the
				strife had ended. Undoubtedly, this was a noble act for
				these people. When the Arabs would come to know that one
				of them had taken upon himself the responsibility
				(hamalah) of someone's debt, they would hasten to his
				help in the discharge of his responsibility. If such a
				person asked for help, it was considered an honorable act
				and not derogatory to his character. No conditions were
				stipulated. As for being qualified to obtain zakah in the
				discharge of such debts, it is not a pre-condition that
				the person who has assumed the debt on another's behalf
				should be unable to pay it. In fact, he can still ask for
				zakah even though he is a man of means.

				Fee sabil lillah means for the sake of Allah--that is,
				making use of knowledge and deeds to attain Allah's
				pleasure. Most scholars understood this phrase as
				fighting for the cause of Allah. Part of zakah designated
				for the cause of Allah is given to volunteer fighters,
				especially those who are not on the payroll of the state,
				regardless of their financial status.

			<p>
				The hadith of the Messenger of Allah, stated elsewhere,
				also confirms it: "Sadaqah is not permitted to the rich
				except to the following five: the warrior (ghuzi) for the
				cause of Allah . . . and so on."
			</p>
			<p>
				As to the pilgrimage (hajj, it does not fall under the
				zakah designated for the cause of Allah because it is an
				obligation for one who can afford it. Commenting on the
				issue, the authors of al-Manar say: "Spending of this
				portion on securing the routes of the pilgrimage and for
				providing water, food, and health services for the
				pilgrims is permissible if funds from other sources are
				not available."
			</p>
			<p>
				Included in the share designated "for the cause of Allah"
				are those spendings in the interest of the common good
				that pertain to both religious and secular matters. The
				foremost is the preparations for war, including buying
				arms, food supplies for soldiers, means of
				transportation, and equipment for warriors. However, the
				supplies for warriors are to be returned to the treasury
				after the war. This applies especially to unconsumable
				items such as weapons, horses, and so on. A warrior does
				not always possess such items, for he uses them in the
				cause of Allah only when necessary. This is not the case,
				however, with other recipients of zakah, such as zakah
				collectors, debtors, people who received money under the
				expense account "reconciliation of hearts," and the
				wayfarers. They do not have to return the zakah, even if
				they are no longer entitled to it.

				Also included in the expense account "for the cause of

				of cruisers, warplanes, fortresses, and trenches. An
				important item in this category could be the preparation
				of Muslim missionaries and sending them to non-Muslim
				countries to spread Islam, just as non-Muslim
				missionaries are now spreading their religions in Islamic
				countries. Also falling under this heading would be
				school expenses to prepare adequate courses in religious
				sciences and in other areas of public interest. Teachers
				involved in such programs should be given sadaqah as long
				as they continue to perform their assigned jobs without
				resorting to other means of income. Scholars who are rich
				should not be paid for their work, despite their obvious
				benefits to the people.

				Ash-Shaf'i and his followers hold that if a distributor

				In that case, it becomes obligatory to distribute the sum

				categories are for some reason ineligible for their
				share, it will be distributed among those still eligible.
				It is not permissible to disregard any category if it

				says that if the amount of zakah received is large, then
				it is possible to divide it among the different
				categories. However, if it is small, it is permissible to
				place it into one category. Ahmad ibn Hanbal holds that
				the division of zakah has a priority but that it is
				permissible to give it all to one category. Malik
				maintains that the distributor of zakah should make an
				effort to investigate those who are in need. He should
				distribute it according to the immediate condition of the
				needy and poor people. Thus, if he sees in certain years
				that the poor need more, they should be given priority.
				If he sees in another year that the wayfarers are more
				needy, he should distribute it among the travelers. The
				Hanafiyyah and Sufyan athThauri thought that the zakah
				payer can choose the categories he wished to distribute
				the zakah to. This is related by Hudhaifah and Ibn

			<p>
				The author of ar-Rawdah an-Nadiyyah says: "Distributing
				all of the zakah to one group is more benefiting to the
				realization of the word of Allah." In brief, one may say
				that Allah made zakah applicable only to the eight
				specifically mentioned categories. Spelling out these
				categories does not mean that the zakah has to be
				distributed among them equally or even that it has to be
				divided among them. The intended meaning, however, is
				that the categories of sadaqah are similar to various
				groups of people who are eligible for it. Thus, one who
				is obligated to pay anything to any category of sadaqah
				and gives it to a person in a parallel group is
				considered to be fulfilling what Allah commanded him to
				do. Contrary to this, if one divides his zakah due into
				the acknowledged eight categories, if all eight exist,
				then that would not only be contrary to the practice of
				the Muslims throughout history, but it would cause
				hardship to the payer of zakah. For example, if the
				collected zakah were meager, it would be of no benefit to
				any designated category--even if it was of one kind, to
				say nothing if it was of numerous kinds. To endorse such
				a practice would be tantamount to counter what the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, did when he permitted the
				payment of a penance (kaffarah) from the charity
				collected for Salmah ibn Sakhr. Obviously, the hadith of
				as-Suda'i cannot be used as evidence.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is not a single case in the entire corpus of hadith
				literature which could be used to make the distribution
				of zakah to all groups of people obligatory. Using the
				hadith of Mu'adh as evidence that the Prophet, upon whom
				be peace, instructed him to take zakah from the rich
				Yemenites and give it to their poor will not be of much
				help because it does not establish that the zakah was
				distributed to all the groups. Nor is the hadith of Ziyad
				ibn al-Harith as-Suda'i valid in this regard because in
				its chain of narrators is 'Abdur-Rahman ibn Ziyad
				al-'Afriqi, whose credibility has been questioned by many
				scholars. Assuming that this hadith is valid for the
				point under discussion, the meaning of the division of
				zakah into parts is its distribution according to the
				apparent meaning of the Qur'anic 'ayah and what the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, had in mind. Assuming that
				the division of zakah itself is intended, the
				distribution has to be done according to the specified
				categories. In this case, any transfer of the share of
				one group to another, even if the group concerned was for
				some reason non-existent, will not be permissible. Such
				an approach will be contrary to the consensus of Muslim
				scholars. If we accept that, then the deciding factor for
				the sadaqah's distribution is the leader's wish rather
				than, and not the specific categories of eligible people.
				Thus, there is no evidence that makes division
				obligatory, and it is consequently permissible to give
				some sadaqah to those eligible people and some to other
				groups. Indeed, when the leader collects all the sadaqat
				from his people and all eight categories are eligible to
				receive them, each group has the right to claim its

				sadaqat among them equally or distribute it without any
				distinction, for he can give any amount to any group or
				groups that he wants to, or he can give some without
				giving the rest if he thinks it is in the interest of

			<p>
				This includes the families of 'Ali, Ja'far, al'Abbas, and
				al-Harith. Ibn Qudamah says there are no two opinions on
				the ineligibility of Banu Hashim to receive zakah. The
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, declared: "Indeed, sadaqah
				ought not to be given to the family of Muhammad ..."
				Muslim related it. Abu Hurairah reported that when
				al-Hasan took one date from the sadaqah dates, the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, said to him: "Nay, spit it
				out! Don't you know that we cannot eat from charity?"
				Scholars agree on the authenticity of this hadith. As to
				the eligibility of Banu al-Muttalib for zakah, the
				scholars differ.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaf'i holds that like Banu Hashim they are
				disallowed to take zakah. Ash-Shaf'i, Ahmad, and
				al-Bukhari relate from Jubair ibn Mut'im who said: "At
				the battle of Khaibar, the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				set aside the share of the relatives of the families of
				Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib and left out the shares
				of Banu Nawfal and Banu 'Abd Shams. I and 'Uthman ibn
				'Affan came to the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be
				peace, and said to him: 'O Messenger of Allah! Do not
				deny Banu Hashim the grace of their position because
				Allah placed you among them. How about our brothers Banu
				al-Muttalib? You gave them and left us out? Isn't our
				relationship one and the same?' The Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, answered: 'I and Banu al-Muttalib are not to be
				separated either during jahiliyyah or Islam. We and they
				are one.' Then he joined his fingers [in demonstrating
				the close relationship]." Reason dictates that one should
				not differentiate between them (the two families) in any
				matter of law because they are one according to the
				saying of the Prophet. It is evident that they are the
				family of Muhammad, and therefore, sadaqat are forbidden
				to them. Abu Hanifah holds that the family of Banu
				al-Muttalib may take from zakah. Both these reports are
				related by Ahmad. Just as the Messenger of Allah, upon
				whom be peace, made charity unlawful for the family of
				Banu Hashim, he also made it unlawful for their proteges
				(mawla). Abu Rafi', a protege of the Prophet, said that
				the latter appointed a man from the family of Banu
				Makhzum to collect sadaqat. This man said to Abu Rafi':
				"Accompany me so that you may get some of it." He said:
				"No, until I meet the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be
				peace, and ask him." He left and asked him. The Prophet
				answered: "Sadaqah is not lawful for us--and the proteges
				of a certain tribe are like [the members of the tribe]
				themselves." Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and at-Tirmidhi related
				it. The latter grades it good (hassan) and sound (sahih).
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether nonobligatory charity (tatawwu') is lawful for
				the family of the Prophet or not, scholars differ.
				Ash-Shaukani, having summarized the views on the issue,
				says: "The apparent meaning of the Prophet's hadith,
				'Sadaqah is unlawful for us,' is the unlawfulness of the
				obligatory as well as nonobligatory sadaqat." A group of
				scholars, including al-Khattabi, says that its
				prohibition for the Prophet, upon whom be peace, carries
				consensus. Based on ashShaf'i's report, many others have
				ruled that the prohibition of zakah to the Prophet does
				not include the nonobligatory charity. A report from
				Ahmad equally says so but Ibn Qudamah rejects all these
				reports for lack of clear evidence.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the family of the Prophet, upon whom be peace, the
				vast majority of the Hanafiyyah, the Shaf'iyyah, the
				Hanbaliyyah, and the majority of the Zaidiyyah hold that
				nonobligatory sadaqah is permissible for them but not the
				obligatory one, since to them the latter is nothing but
				filth that comes out from people's holdings. This is
				understood to mean that the (prescribed) zakah and not
				the nonobligatory sadaqat, are forbidden to them. It is
				said in alBahr that nonobligatory sadaqah is restricted
				by being confined to a donation, gift, or endowment. Abu
				Yusuf and Abu al-'Abbas maintain that it is unlawful for
				them, as is the prescribed charity, because there is no
				evidence of the contrary.

				The Messenger of Allah used to send his authorized agents

				is no difference between unhidden wealth (i.e., plants,
				fruit, cattle, and minerals) and hidden wealth (i.e.,
				trade goods, gold, silver, and treasure). When 'Uthman
				became caliph, he followed this practice for a while.
				Later on, when he saw that the hidden wealth was
				tremendous and that pursuing it embarrassed the community
				and while checking it harmed its owners, he left the
				payment of the zakah on such property to the individual's
				discretion. Jurists agree that the owners themselves
				should assume the distribution of zakah, especially when
				it is for hidden wealth. As-Sa'ib ibn Yazid reported: "I
				once heard the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace. He
				said: 'This is the month of your zakah. If any one of you

				A poor husband is entitled to receive zakah from his

				'Consider the debt for [my] zakah.' Would it be valid?"
				An-Nawawi says there are two opinions on it. According to
				Ahmad and Abu Hanifah, who held the better opinion, it
				does not constitute zakah because it cannot be discharged
				unless actually paid, while Hasan al-Basri and 'Ata
				maintain that the responsibility to pay zakah will be
				discharged even though there is no payment of zakah (at
				that point in time) by its payer.

				Likewise, if an individual trustingly assigns some money

				The jurists, however, agree that if a person pays zakah

				The jurists agree that zakah can be transferred from one

				whom the zakah was originally derived from have first
				been satisfied. A large number of hadith on the subject
				stress the need for depleting zakah among the poor and
				the needy of the city from which it is collected. This is
				because zakah aims at freeing the poor inhabitants of an
				area from want, and thus its transfer would contribute to
				their deprivation. This is substantiated by the hadith of
				Mu'adh: "Tell them that there is a charity due upon them
				to be taken from their rich and to be given back to their
				poor." Abu Juhaifah reported: "The charity collector of
				the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, came to us
				and took zakah from our rich and gave it to our poor. I

				'Imran ibn Husain reports that he was employed as a

				"Did you send me for the collection? We took it and
				distributed it the way we did at the time of the
				Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace." This is related
				by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah. On the same subject, Tawus
				says: "Mu'adh wrote in his letter: 'Anyone who moves from
				one location to another, his charity and tithe remain in
				the location of his tribe.'" This is related by al-Athram
				in his Sunan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on such hadith, the jurists say that the poor of a
				city have a prior claim over the local zakah than the
				poor elsewhere. Still, they differ over which conditions
				must prevail before zakah can be transferred from one
				city to another.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafiyyah hold that transferring zakah is disliked
				(makruh) unless it is for needy relatives and serves the
				ties of blood, or when the needs of a group of Muslims
				are more pressing than those of the locals, when it is
				tied to the general interests of the Muslims, when it is
				sought from a country at war against the Muslims to the
				land of Islam, when it is intended for a scholar, or when
				zakah is paid before the completion of the hawl. In those
				cases, transferring zakah is not disliked (makruh).
			</p>
			<p>
				The Shaf'iyyah maintain that transferring zakah is not
				allowed and that it must be spent in the area of its
				origin, unless it has no poor or other categories of
				zakah recipients. 'Amr ibn Shu'aib reported that the
				Messenger of Allah, upon whom be peace, appointed Mu'adh
				ibn Jabal to a position in Jund where the latter remained
				until the death of the Prophet. At the time of this
				event, he came to 'Umar who reappointed him. He sent to
				'Umar one-third of the sadaqat collected from the local
				people, but 'Umar turned it down and said: "I did not
				appoint you to go there as a tax collector or as a
				tribute (jizyah) taker. I appointed you to collect
				sadaqat from the rich and then to return them to their
				poor." Mu'adh replied: "I would not have sent you
				anything [from the collection] if I had found someone
				deserving [over here]."
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second year, he sent him half of the collected
				sadaqat, and they ran into the same issue again. In the
				third year, he sent him all of it, and 'Umar again argued
				with him. Mu'adh responded: "I could not find anyone who
				deserved to receive anything from me." This is related by
				Abu 'Ubaid.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malik holds that transferring zakah is allowed only when
				there is a desperate need. The administration then can
				send it to the other place after due consideration of all
				the facts. The Hanbaliyyah say that it is not permissible
				to transfer zakah from its place of origin to that of the
				place beyond which salat ul-qasr is applicable. It must
				be spent in the place which generated it or near to it
				but not beyond the point of qasr.

				Abu Dawud says: "I heard Ahmad saying 'no' when asked if

				Asked further, 'What if his [the zakah payer's] relatives
				are in the other city?' he replied: 'No. It can be
				transferred only when the needs of the poor residents of
				a city have been satisfied.' " This is based on the
				preceding hadith of Abu 'Ubaid. Ibn Qudamah holds that
				even if the zakah payer violated the above stipulations
				by transferring it, he would still have met his
				obligation. Most of the scholars also support this view.
				When a man resides in one city and his holdings happen to
				be in another, consideration will be given to the city
				where his holdings are located because the holdings
				generated zakah and the eligible people will be eyeing
				it. If part of the holdings are with the owner and some
				are in another city, zakah will be paid on the portion in
				each city. This applies to zakah on one's holdings. As
				for the zakah at the end of Ramadan (zakat ul-fitr), it
				is distributed in the city where it is due, whether the
				payer's holdings are there or not. This is because this
				type of zakah is associated with the person rather than
				with the holdings.

				The topic of recipients versus non-recipients of zakah

				Ma'an ibn Yazid reports: "My father set aside a few
				dinars for sadaqah and gave them to a man in the mosque.
				I went and took them and brought them back to my father.
				He said: 'By Allah! What have you done?' I consulted the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, about it. The Prophet
				observed: 'O Yazid, for you is what you intended and O
				Ma'an, for you is what you have taken.' " This is related
				by Ahmad and al-Bukhari. The meaning of this hadith is
				that sadaqah is supererogatory (nafl); however, the word
				ma (meaning what) in laka rna nawayta (for you is what
				you intended) denotes generalization. Abu Hanifah and
				Muhammad are supported in their stand by a hadith from
				Abu Hurairah which reports the Prophet, upon whom be
				peace, saying: "A man [from Banu Isra'il] said [to
				himself]: 'Tonight I will give away something in
				sadaqah.' So he went out with his sadaqah and
				[unknowlingly] gave it to a thief. The next moming he was
				told by the people that he had given sadaqah to a thief.
				[On hearing this,] he said: 'O Allah! Praised be You.
				Certainly I will give sadaqah again.' So, he went out
				with his sadaqah and [unknowingly] gave it to an
				adulteress. The next moming he was told that he had given
				sadaqah to an adulteress. The man said: 'O Allah! Praised
				be You. [I gave my sadaqah] to an adulteress. Certainly I
				will give sadaqah again.' Thus he went out with his
				sadaqah again and [unknowingly] gave it to a rich person.
				The next moming the people said that the night before he
				had given his sadaqah to a wealthy person. He said: 'O
				Allah! Praised be You. [I have given my sadaqah] to an
				adulteress, a thief, and a rich person.' [In his dreams]
				he saw someone saying to him: 'The sadaqah you gave to
				the thief might make him abstain from stealing, and that
				given to the adulteress might make her abstain from
				illegal sex [adultery], and that given to the wealthy
				person might make him learn a lesson from it and spend
				his wealth, which Allah, the Exalted One, has given him
				in Allah's cause.' " This is related by Ahmad,
				al-Bukhari, and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet, upon whom be peace, said to a man who asked
				him for sadaqah: "If you were eligible for zakah, I would
				have given you your due." He (the Prophet) gave (zakah)
				to two well built persons saying: "If you wish, I will
				give from it [sadaqah]. There is no portion in it for a
				wealthy person or a healthy individual who is eaming."
				Ibn Qudamah says: "If he would have considered the
				reality of the rich person, he would not have been
				contented with what they said [conceming this matter]."
			</p>
			<p>
				The opinion of Malik, ash-Shaf'i, Abu Yusuf, ath-Thauri,
				and Ibn al-Mundhir is that it will not be sufficient for
				a zakah payer to give it to the undeserving, especially
				when his mistake becomes clear. In that case, he should
				pay zakah once again to those who deserve it. His case is
				similar to the case of unpaid debts (owed) to other
				people. Ahmad says that there are two opinions conceming
				one paying zakah to a person whom he thought was poor and
				later leamed was rich. The first contends it would be
				considered paid, while the second says that it would not
				be. When it becomes known that one who received zakah is
				a slave, an unbeliever, a Hashimite (a person from the
				Prophet's family), or an ineligible relative of the zakah
				payer, then one has not discharged one's obligation, the
				reason being that it is difficult to know who is rich and
				who is poor: "The ignorant man thinks that since they
				[who do not ask for] are modest they are free from want"
				[al-Baqarah 273].

				The required amount of zakat ul-fitr is one sa' of wheat,

				Hanifah made it permissible to set aside, as a zakat
				ul-fitr, an equivalent value and also said that if the
				payer pays in wheat, one-half of a sa' would be
				sufficient. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: "We used to
				give on behalf of every child, old person, freeman, and
				slave during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah, upon
				whom be peace, one sa' of food, or one sa' of dried

				then addressed the people from the pulpit and said to
				them: 'I see that two mudds of wheat of Syria equals one
				sa' of dates.' The people accepted that." However, Abu

				give, namely, one sa' as long as I live." This is related
				by most hadith narrators. At-Tirmidhi remarks: "Some of

				[which is accepted as a sound practice]." Ash-Shaf'i and
				Ishaq sustain this view but some other scholars gave one
				sa' from every charitable item except wheat, of which
				only half a sa' would be sufficient. This is the saying

				Ath-Thauri, Ahmad, Ishaq, and ash-Shaf'i (in his later

				zakat ul-fitr before the people went out to perform the
				'id prayers. Nafi' reports that 'Umar used to pay it a

				hold different opinions when a longer time period is

			</p>
			<p>
				The founders of the four accepted Islamic legal schools
				agree that zakat ul-fitr is not nullified simply by not

		<section heading="Are There Other Claims on Wealth Besides Zakah?">
			<p>
				Islam views wealth realistically--as an essential aspect
				of life and the main means of subsistence of individuals
				and groups. Allah, the Exalted One, instructs: "Give not
				to those who are weak of understanding [what is in] your
				wealth which Allah has made a means of support for you"
				[an-Nisa' 5]. This amounts to saying that wealth is to be
				distributed to meet the basic needs of food, clothing,
				lodging, and other indispensables, and that no one is to
				be lost, forgotten, or left without support. The best way
				to distribute wealth so that everyone's basic needs are
				met is through zakah. It does not place any burden on the
				wealthy yet at the same time it meets the basic needs of
				the poor and relieves them of the hardships of life and
				the pain of deprivation. Zakah is not a favor (minnah)
				that the wealthy bestow upon the poor; rather, it is a
				due (haqq) that Allah entrusted in the hands of the rich
				to deliver to the poor and distribute among the
				deserving. Thus, the eminent truth about wealth and
				property is established--that is, wealth is not
				exclusively for the rich but for both the rich and the
				poor. This becomes obvious because of Allah's judgment
				concerning the distribution of booty (fay'). Allah warns:
				". . . that it does not become a commodity taken by turns
				among the rich of you" [al-Hashr 7]. This means it is an
				apportionment of wealth between the rich and the poor,
				not something restricted to the wealthy. Zakah is an
				obligation due on the property of those able to pay and
				is to be used to meet the basic needs of the poor and the
				needy so that they could be kept away from hunger and
				they could be given a sense of security and general
				well-being. If the amount of zakah is not enough to
				alleviate the conditions of the poor and the needy, then
				the rich can be subjected to further taxation. How much
				should be taken is not specified. Its quantity will be
				determined by the needs of the poor.

				In his interpretation of  alBaqarah 177, al-Qurtubi says:
				"The saying of Allah, the Exalted One: 'And to spend of
				your wealth out of love for Him' gives credence to those
				who maintain that there is a due on wealth other than
				zakah known as mal addir." Others hold that the preceding
				'ayah alludes to the obligatory zakah. According to
				ad-Daraqutni's report from Fatimah bint Qais, the first
				view is more convincing. She relates: "Indeed, there is a
				due on one's holdings other than the prescribed zakah."
				Then he recited the following Qur'anic verse: "It is not
				righteousness that you turn your faces to the East or to
				the West, but it is to believe in Allah, the Last Day,
				the Angels, the Book, the Messengers, and to spend of
				your wealth out of love for Him on your kin, orphans, the
				needy, the wayfarer, or those who ask, and on the ransom
				of slaves..." [al-Baqarah 177]. Ibn Majah mentioned it in
				his Sunan and at-Tirmidhi in his Jami'. The latter says
				that Ibn Majah's has a different chain of narrators than
				his. Besides, Abu Hamzah and Maymun al-'A'war consider
				Ibn Majah's chain of narrator not credible. This hadith
				is related by Bayan and Isma'il ibn Salim from
				ash-Shu'bi, who said that it is sound.
			</p>
			<p>
				The latter says: "If there is a question about its
				authenticity, it is rendered clear by the context of the
				'ayah [al-Baqarah 177]. In this statement: '... to be
				steadfast in prayer, and to give zakah,' Allah mentions
				zakah with salah, which substantiates the fact that 'to
				spend of your property out of love for Him' does not
				refer to obligatory zakah, for that would be redundant in
				the 'ayah--and Allah knows best."
			</p>
			<p>
				The scholars agree that should a need arise, even when
				zakah has been paid, the Muslim community is bound to
				contribute toward the alleviation of the problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malik says: "It is obligatory for the people to ransom
				those taken as prisoners of war, even if doing so
				consumes all their property. The consensus on this
				subject strengthens our view, and we seek success only
				through Allah." According to al-Manar, the 'ayah "... and
				to spend your property out of love for Him . . ."
				[alBaqarah 177] means that one should give the property
				for the sake of Allah or for the love of giving it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imam Muhammad 'Abduh's comments are: "The giving of
				property in excess of the due zakah is considered one of
				the basic elements of piety (birr) and is enjoined like
				the prescribed zakah."
			</p>
			<p>
				Whenever the exigency calls for it, sadaqah other than
				zakah is given. That could be before the completion of
				the year (hawl) or after the payment of zakah. The
				contribution is not based on a specific amount of nisab
				but on the ability to give. Thus, if someone possesses
				only a loaf of bread and sees a person who is more
				hard-pressed than himself, he should give it to that
				person. The hard-pressed person is not the only one who
				has a right to be satisfied, but Allah has also ordered
				the believers to give non-prescribed sadaqat to the
				following: kin, orphans, needy, wayfarers, beggars, and
				slaves.

				Ibn Hazm says: "It is enjoined upon the rich of every

				authority to force them to do so. This is called for when
				the pre~,cribed zakah or the holdings of other Muslims
				are not enough to meet the needs of the poor. In that

				the elements and the eyes of the passer-by would be
				provided by the rich." The proof for this is in the
				saying of Allah, the Exalted One: "Give the kinsman his
				due, and the needy, and the wayfarer" [al-Isra' 26].
				Allah also says: "[Show] kindness to parents, to near kin
				and orphans, to the needy, to relatives, to neighbors who
				are not related to you, to fellow travelers and
				wayfarers, and [to the slaves] whom your right hand
				possesses" [an-Nisa' 36]. Generosity urges support for
				the above-mentioned people and forbids harming them.
				Referring to the guilty in the life to come, the Qur'an
				says that they would ask each other: "What brought you to
				this hellfire?" They will answer: "We were not of those
				who prayed, nor did we feed the needy" [al-Muddaththir
				42-44]. Thus, Allah links feeding the needy with
				performing prayers. According to the following hadith,
				related by authentic sources, the Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, said: "He who does not have mercy
				upon people, Allah's mercy will be kept from him." Anyone
				upon whom Allah bestowed His grace and who sees his
				Muslim brother hungry, in need of clothes, and miserable,
				and still does not help him, he will, indeed, deprive
				himself of Allah's mercy.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Uthman an-Nahdi reported that 'Abdurrahman ibn Abi Bakr
				as-Siddiq informed him that the companions of as-Saffah
				were poor and that the Messenger of Allah, upon whom be
				peace, said: "He who has enough food for two, let him
				invite a third, and he who has food for four, let him
				invite a fifth or a sixth."
			</p>
			<p>
				It is related from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, said: "A Muslim is a brother of
				another, and he should neither do injustice to him nor
				betray him." Thus, anyone who lets a needy Muslim go
				without food or clothes while, in fact, he is able to
				feed and clothe him would have betrayed him. It is
				related from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that the Messenger of
				Allah, upon whom be peace, said: "He whose holdings
				exceed his needs, let him support the one whose holdings
				do not, and he whose food exceeds his needs, let him
				share it with him who does not have food." Abu Sa'id
				al-Khudri says: "Then he mentioned so many kinds of
				property that we thought no one of us had the right to
				have anything surplus with us." This is the consensus of
				the companions, as it was reported by Abu Sa'id alKhudri.
				Concerning this tradition, it is reported on the
				authority of Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the Prophet, upon
				whom be peace, said: "Feed the hungry, visit the sick,
				and ransom the prisoner."
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many 'ayahs in the Qur'an and numerous sound
				hadith on this subject. 'Umar says: "If I were to live
				again the past which I have already lived, I would take
				the surplus from the rich and distribute it among the
				poor immigrants (mujhajirun)." This is considered to be
				the most authentic report.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Ali said: "Allah, the Exalted One, has placed a due upon
				the properties of the rich to meet the needs of the poor.
				Thus, if the poor go hungry or naked or struggle because
				of the neglect of the rich, then Allah will hold them
				[the rich] accountable on the Day of Judgment and will
				punish them."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar is reported to have said: "There is a due on
				your property other than zakah." It is related from
				'Aishah (the mother of the believers), al-Hasan ibn 'Ali,
				Ibn 'Umar that all of them replied to those who had asked
				them: "If you are asked for help in cases of blood money,
				heavy debt, or desperate poverty, then it is a must for
				you to give them from your holdings."
			</p>
			<p>
				It was accurately reported by Abu 'Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah
				and 300 companions that (once) when their provisions had
				run very low, Abu 'Ubaidah ordered them to collect what
				was left and place it into two bags and then allot it to
				each one equally. Then he said: "It is not permissible
				for a hard-pressed Muslim to eat the meat of a dead
				animal or a pig when he can find surplus food from either
				a Muslim or a dhimmi. It is an obligation of the one who
				has food to feed the hungry." This has the consensus
				among the companions, and there are no contrary views
				concerning it. It was accurately reported from ashShu'bi,
				Mujahid, Tawus, and others that: "There is a due on
				property other than zakah." If such is the case, then a
				hard-pressed person is not forced to eat the meat of dead
				animals or pigs. He has the right to fight for it and, if
				he is killed, then retaliation by killing (qawad) will be
				imposed upon the killer. If the property holder who
				prevents him from receiving his due is killed, then may
				he have the curse of Allah upon him because he withheld a
				right (haqq), and he will be regarded as being among the
				unjust.
			</p>
			<p>
				Allah, the Exalted One, says: "And if one party of them
				does wrong to the other, fight those who do wrong until
				they return to the ordinance of Allah." Thus, one who
				withholds a right is an oppressor of his brother. The
				latter is the possessor of that right. On this basis, Abu
				Bakr as-Siddiq waged war against those who refused to pay
				their zakah.
			</p>
			<p>
				From the preceding, one can see the degree of compassion
				and commiseration that Islam has for the deprived. Islam,
				in fact, excels over all other faiths and systems. They
				are like weak, sputtering candles when placed next to the
				bright and steady light of the sun of Islam.

				Abu Hurairah reported the Messenger of Allah, upon whom

				of Adam is for him except fasting, for that is solely for
				Me. I give the reward for it.' The fast is a shield. If
				one is fasting, he should not use foul language, raise
				his voice, or behave foolishly. If someone reviles him or
				fights with him he should say, 'I am fasting,' twice. By
				the One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, the [bad]
				breath of the one who is fasting is better in the sight
				of Allah on the Day of Resurrection than the smell of
				musk. The one who is fasting is happy at two times: when
				he breaks his fast he is happy with it, and when he meets
				his Lord he will be happy that he has fasted." This is
				related by Ahmad, Muslim, and an-Nasa'i. A similar
				version was recorded by al-Bukhari and Abu Dawud, but
				with the following addition: "He leaves his food, drink,
				and desires for My sake. His fasting is for Me... I will
				give the reward for it, and for every good deed, he will

				'Abdullah ibn 'Amr reported that the Messenger of Allah,

				from his food and desires during the day. Let me
				intercede for him.' The Qur'an will say: 'I prevented him
				from sleeping at night. Let me intercede for him.' And
				their intercession will be accepted." Ahmad related this

				Abu Umamah reported: "I came to the Messenger of Allah
				and said: 'Order me to do a deed that will allow me to

				The fast of Ramadan, according to the Qur'an, sunnah and

			<p>
				The evidence from the Qur'an consists of the following
				two verses: "O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for
				you as it was prescribed for the people before you in
				order for you to gain God consciousness, and, "...The
				month of Ramadan, during which the Qur'an was revealed, a

				From the sunnah we have the following statements of the
				Prophet: "Islam is built upon [the following] five
				pillars: testifying that there is no God except Allah and
				that Muhammad is His Messenger, the establishment of the
				prayer, the giving of zakah, the fast of Ramadan and the
				pilgrimage to Makkah." Talhah ibn 'Ubaidullah reported
				that a man came to the Prophet and said: "O Messenger of
				Allah, tell me what Allah requires of me as regards

				asked: "Is there any other [fast]?" The Prophet answered:
				"No, unless you do so voluntarily."

				This event is confirmed by sighting the new moon, even if

				Ibn 'Umar said: "The people were looking for the new moon
				and when I reported to the Messenger of Allah that I had

				Commenting on these reports, at-Tirmidhi states: "Most
				knowledgeable people act in accordance with these
				reports. They say that it is correct to accept the
				evidence of one person to determine the beginning of the
				fast. This is the opinion of Ibn alMubarak, ash-Shaf'i,
				and Ahmad. An-Nawawi says that it is the soundest
				opinion. Conceming the new moon of Shawwal [which
				signifies the end of the fast], it is confimmed by
				completing thirty days of Ramadan, and most jurists state
				that the new moon must have been reported by at least two
				just witnesses. However, Abu Thaur does not distinguish
				between the new moon of Shawwal and the new moon of
				Ramadan. In both cases, he accepts the evidence of only
				one just witness."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn-Rushd comments that: "The opionion of Abu Bakr ibn
				alMundhir, which is also that of Abu Thaur and, I
				suspect, that of the Dhahiri school of thought, is
				supported by the following argument given by Abu Bakr
				al-Mundhiri: there is complete agreement that breaking
				the fast is obligatory, that abstaining from eating is
				based on one person's report, and that the situation must
				be like that for the beginning of the month and for the
				ending of the month, as both of them are simply the signs
				that differentiate the time of fasting from the time of
				not fasting."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaukani observes: "If there is nothing authentic
				recorded that states that one may only accept two
				witnesses for the end of the month, then it is apparent,
				by analogy, that one witness is sufficient, as it is
				sufficient for the beginning of the month. Furthemmore,
				worship based on the acceptance of one report points to
				the fact that such singular reports are accepted in every
				matter unless there is some evidence that specifies the

				According to the majority of scholars, it does not matter

				In other words, after the new moon is seen anywhere in
				the world, it becomes obligatory for all Muslims to begin
				fasting, as the Prophet said: "Fast due to its sighting
				and break the fast due to its sighting." This hadith is a
				general address directed to the whole Muslim world - that
				is, "if any one of you sees the moon in any place, then
				that will be a sighting for all of the people."
			</p>
			<p>
				According to 'Ikrimah, al-Qasim ibn Muhammad, Salim,
				Ishaq, the correct opinion among the Hanafiyyah, and the
				chosen opinion among the Shaf'iyyah, every "country" (or
				territory) is to take into consideration its own sighting
				and not necessarily to follow the sighting of others.
				This is based on what Kuraib said: "While I was in
				ash-Sham, the new moon of Ramadan appeared on Thursday
				night. I retumed to Madinah at the end of the month.
				There, Ibn 'Abbas asked me: 'When did you people see the
				new moon?' I said: 'We saw it on Thursday night.' He
				said: 'Did you see it yourself?' I said: 'Yes, the people
				saw it, and they and Mu'awiyyyah fasted.' He said: 'But
				we saw it on Friday night. We will not stop fasting until
				we complete thirty days or until we see the new moon.' I
				said: 'Isn't Mu'awiyyah's sighting and fasting sufficient

				Allah instructs in the Qur'an: "And they are ordained
				nothing else than to serve Allah, keeping religion pure
				for Him." The Prophet, upon whom be peace, said: "Actions
				are judged according to the intention behind them, and
				for everyone is what he intended."
			</p>
			<p>
				The intention must be made before fajr and during every
				night of Ramadan. This point is based on the hadith of
				Hafsah which reported that the Prophet said: "Whoever
				does not determine to fast before fajr will have no fast"
				(that is, it won't be accepted). This is related by
				Ahmad, an-Nasa'i, at-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Majah.
				Ibn Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibban have classified it as sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				The intention is valid during any part of the night. It
				need not be spoken, as it is in reality an act of the
				heart which does not involve the tongue. It will be
				fulfilled by one's intention to fast out of obedience to
				Allah and for seeking His pleasure.
			</p>
			<p>
				If one eats one's pre-dawn meal (sahoor) with the
				intention of fasting and to get closer to Allah by such
				abstinence, then one has performed the intention. If one
				determines that one will fast on the next day solely for
				the sake of Allah, then one has performed the intention
				even if a pre-dawn meal was not consumed.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to many of the jurists, the intention for a
				voluntary fast may be made at any time before any food is
				consumed. This opinion is based on 'Aishah's hadith: "The
				Prophet came to us one day and said: 'Do you have any
				[food]?' We said, 'No.' He said: 'Therefore, I am
				fasting." This is related by Muslim and Abu Dawud.

				The Hanafiyyah and Shaf'iyyah stipulate that the
				intention must be made before noon (for voluntary fasts).

				Elderly men and women are permitted to break their fasts,

				difficult jobs under harsh circumstances and who could
				not find any other way to support themselves. All of

				such a practice would place too much hardship on them
				during any part of the year. They are obliged to feed one
				poor person [miskin] a day (for every day of fasting that
				they do not perform). The scholars differ over how much
				food is to be supplied, for example, a sa', half a sa',
				or a madd. There is nothing in the sunnah that mentions
				exactly how much is to be given.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas said: "An elderly man is permitted to break
				his fast, but he must feed a poor person daily. If he
				does this, he does not have to make up the days that he
				did not fast. This is related by ad-Daraqutni and by
				al-Hakim, who said it is sahih. Al-Bukhari recorded that
				'Ata heard Ibn 'Abbas recite the 'ayah: "And for those
				who can fast [but do not], there is a "ransom': the
				feeding of a person in need" [al-Baqarah 185]. Then Ibn
				'Abbas continued: "It has not been abrogated. [Its ruling
				applies] to elderly men and women who are not able to
				fast. Instead, they must feed one poor person on a daily
				basis."

				The same is true for one who is chronically ill and as
				such cannot fast, and for one who is forced to work under
				harsh circumstances and as such cannot endure the
				additional burden of fasting. Both groups must also feed
				one poor person daily.
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on al-Baqarah's 'ayah, Sheikh Muhammad 'Abduh
				says: "What is meant by those who can fast' [(but do not)
				in the Qur'anic verse] is the weak elderly people, the
				chronically ill, and so on, and similarly, those workers
				who are working under severe conditions, such as coal
				miners. The same applies to criminals who are sentenced
				to life imprisonment with hard labor. They have to pay
				the 'ransom' if they have the means to do so."
			</p>
			<p>
				Pregnant and breast-feeding women, if they fear for
				themselves or for the baby, can break the fast and pay
				the "ransom." They do not have to make up the days
				missed. Abu Dawud related from 'Ikrimah that Ibn 'Abbas
				said concerning the 'ayah "And for those who can fast
				[but do not],": "This is a concession for the elderly, as
				they can fast. They are to break the fast and feed one
				poor person a day. Pregnant or breast-feeding women, if
				they fear for the child, can do likewise." This is
				related by al-Bazzar. At the end of the report, there is
				the addition: "Ibn 'Abbas used to say to his wives who
				were pregnant: 'You are in the same situation as those
				who can fast [but do not]. You are to pay the "ransom"
				and do not have to make up the days later.' " Of its

				confirmed." This is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and
				alBaihaqi with a sahih chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				A sick person may break his fast which, if continued,
				would only aggravate the illness or delay its cure.In
				al-Mughni it is stated: "It is related from some of the
				early scholars that any type of illness allows one to
				break the fast, even an injury to the finger or a
				toothache. They based their opinion on the following: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					the wording of the verse is general and applies
					to all types of illness, and 
				</li>
				<li>
					a traveler is allowed to break his fast even if
					he does not need to and, therefore, the same must
					be the case for one who is sick." This was also
					the opinion of al-Bukhari, 'Ata, and the Dhahiri
					school of thought.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				One who is healthy but fears that he will become ill if
				he fasts can break the fast, as can the person who is
				overcome by hunger and/or thirst and fears that he may
				die because of it, even if he is resident and healthy. He
				must make up the days of fasting that he missed. The
				following two Qur'anic 'ayahs support this point: "And do
				not kill yourselves, Lo! Allah is ever Merciful to you,"
				and "He has not laid upon you in your religion any
				hardship."
			</p>
			<p>
				If a sick person fasts and withstands the hardships of
				the fast, his fast will be valid but disliked, for he did
				not accept the concession Allah gave him, thereby causing
				himself much hardship. Some of the companions would fast
				during the Prophet's lifetime while others would not
				(that is, if they were ill), thereby following the
				verdict of the Prophet. Hamzah al-Aslami said: "O
				Messenger of Allah, I find within me the strength to fast
				while traveling. Would there be any blame upon me if I
				were to do so?" The Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				answered: "It is a concession from Allah. Whoever takes
				it has done well. Whoever likes to fast, there is no
				blame upon him." This is related by Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: "We traveled with the
				Messenger of Allah to Makkah while we were fasting. We
				stopped at a place and the Messenger of Allah said: 'You
				are coming close to your enemies. You will be stronger if
				you break the fast.' That was a concession and some of us
				fasted and some of us broke our fasts. Then we came to
				another place and the Prophet said: 'In the morning you
				will face your enemy. Breaking the fast will give you
				more strength.' So we broke our fast, taking that as the
				best course of action. After that, you could see some of
				us fasting with the Prophet while traveling." This is
				related by Ahmad, Muslim, and Abu Dawud.
			</p>
			<p>
				In another report, Abu Sa'id al-Khudri said: "We fought
				under the leadership of the Messenger of Allah during
				Ramadan. Some of us fasted and some of us did not. The
				ones who fasted did not find any fault with those who did
				not fast, and those who did not fast found no fault with
				those who fasted. They knew that if one had the strength
				to fast he could do so and it was good, and that if one
				was weak, he was allowed to break his fast, and that was
				good." This is related by Ahmad and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				The jurists differ over what is preferred (that is, to
				fast or not to fast while traveling). Abu Hanifah,
				ash-Shaf'i, and Malik are of the opinion that if one has
				the ability to fast, it is better for him to do so, and
				if one does not have the ability to fast, it is better
				for him to break the fast. Ahmad said that it is best to
				break the fast. 'Umar ibn 'Abdulaziz says: "The best of
				the two acts is the easier of the two. If it is easier
				for one to fast than to make up the day later on, then,
				in his case, to fast is better."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaukani has concluded that if it is difficult for an
				individual to fast or to reject the concession, then it
				is best for him not to fast (while traveling). Similarly,
				if one fears that one's fasting during travel will look
				like showing off, then in this case, breaking the fast
				would be preferred. If one is not faced with such
				conditions, then fasting would be preferred.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a traveler makes the intention (to fast) during the
				night, he can still break his fast during the day. Jabir
				ibn 'Abdullah reported:
			</p>
			<p>
				"The Messenger of Allah left for Makkah during the year
				of the conquest [of Makkah] and he and the people with
				him fasted until he reached a certain valley. He then
				called for a cup of water, which he elevated so that the
				people could see it, and then he drank. Afterwards, he
				was told that some people had continued to fast, and he
				said: 'Those are disobedient ones, those are disobedient
				ones.' " This is related by Muslim, at-Tirmidhi, and
				an-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi called it sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				If one has already made the intention to fast while
				resident but then decided to travel during the day, the
				majority of scholars maintain that he must fast. Ahmad
				and Ishaq say that he may break the fast. This opinion is
				based on the report of Muhammad ibn Ka'b who said: "I
				came to Anas ibn Malik during Ramadan while he was
				planning on traveling. His mount was prepared for him,
				and he was wearing his clothes for traveling. He asked
				for some food and ate. I said to him: 'Is this a sunnah?'
				He said, 'Yes.' Then he mounted his animal and left."
				This is related by at-Tirmidhi, who called it
				hassan.'Ubaid ibn Jubair said: "During Ramadan, I rode on
				a ship with Abu Basra al-Ghafari from al-Fustat. He
				prepared his food and said, "Come [and eat]." I said:
				"Are we not still among the houses [of the city - that
				is, they had not left yet]?" Abu Basra asked: "Are you
				turning away from the sunnah of the Messenger of Allah?"
				This is related by Ahmad and Abu Dawud. Its narrators are
				trustworthy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shaukani contends: "These two hadith prove that a
				traveler may break his fast before he begins his joumey.
				Of its credentials, Ibn al-'Arabi says: 'Concerning the
				hadith of Anas, it is sahih and proves that one can break
				the fast when he is prepared to travel.'" This is the
				correct position.
			</p>
			<p>
				The type of travel that allows one to break his fast is
				the same as the traveling which allows one to shorten the
				prayers. We have discussed all of the opinions on this
				point under the section Shortening the Prayers, and we
				have also recorded Ibn al-Qayyim's conclusions on this
				question.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Baihaqi, and at-Tahawi recorded from
				Mansur al-Kalbi that Dihya ibn Khalifah traveled a
				distance of one farsakh during Ramadan. When he broke his
				fast, some of the people accompanying him did likewise.
				Some of them did not agree with this action. On his
				return to his city, Dihya said: "I saw some hing today
				that I did not suspect I would ever see. The people tumed
				away the Messenger of Allah's guidance and that of his
				companions." He said that about the people who had
				fasted. Then he said: "O Allah, take [my soul] to you."
				All of its narrators are trustworthy, except for Mansur
				al-Kalbi... although al-'Ijli affirms his credibility.

				The Prophet would fast most of the month of Sha'ban.
				'Aishah said: "I never saw the Messenger of Allah fast a
				complete month save for Ramadan, and I have never seen
				him fast more in a month than he did in Sha'ban." This is
				related by al-Bukhari and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Usamah ibn Zaid inquired: "O Messenger of Allah, I never
				find you fasting in any month like you do during the
				month of Sha'ban." The Prophet responded: "That is a
				month the people neglect. It comes between Rajab and
				Ramadan. It is a month in which the deeds are raised to
				the Lord of the Worlds. I love that my deeds be raised
				while I am fasting." This is related by Abu Dawud,
				an-Nasa'i, and by Ibn Khuzaimah in his Sahih.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some people fast on the 15th of Sha'ban in particular,
				thinking that that day contains more virtues than the
				other days. This is an unsubstantiated claim.

			<p>
				The "forbidden" months (during which killing is
				forbidden) are Dhul-Qidah, DhulHijjah, Muharram, and
				Rajab. It is preferred to fast a lot during these months.

				A man from Bahila came to the Prophet and said: "O
				Messenger of Allah, I am the man who came to you during
				the first year." The Prophet, upon whom be peace, said:
				"What has changed you? You used to be much more
				handsome!" He answered: "I did not eat save during the
				night since I left you." The Messenger of Allah asked:
				"Why did you punish yourself? Fast during the month of
				patience [that is, Ramadan] and then one day of every
				month." The man said: "Add something to that for me, for
				I have more strength than that." The Prophet responded:
				"Fast two days [a month]." The man said: "Add more for
				me." The Prophet said three times: "Fast from the
				forbidden months, then leave fasting." He pointed with
				three of his fingers by clenching them and releasing
				them. This is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and
				al-Baihaqi with a good chain.

				Fasting during Rajab contains no more virtue than during
				any other month. There is no sound report from the sunnah
				that states that it has a special reward. All that has
				been related concerning it is not strong enough to be
				used as a proof. Ibn Hajr says: "There is no authentic

				The time for the pre-dawn meal is between the middle of

				If one is in doubt whether or not the time of fajr has

				on doubt or suspicion. Allah has made the signs for
				beginning the daily fast very clear and unambiguous.
				Allah enjoins (upon the believers) in the Qur'an: "Eat

				A man said to Ibn 'Abbas: "I eat until I suspect that its

				The fast should be broken with an odd number of dates or,
				if that is not available, with some water. Anas reported:
				"The Messenger of Allah would break his fast with ripe
				dates before he would pray. If those were not available,
				he would eat dried dates. If those were not available, he

		<section heading="Refraining from performing any actions that do not befit the fasting">
			<p>
				Fasting is a type of worship that draws one closer to
				Allah. Allah has prescribed it to purify the soul and to
				train it in good deeds. The fasting person must be on
				guard against any act that may cause him to lose the
				benefits of his fast. Thus, his fast will increase his
				God-consciousness, and Allah says in the Qur'an: "O you
				who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was
				prescribed for those before you so perchance you may
				attain God consciousness."
			</p>
			<p>
				Fasting is not just refraining from eating and drinking,
				but it is also refraining from everything else that Allah
				has forbidden. Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet
				said: "Fasting is not [abstaining] from eating and
				drinking only, but also from vain speech and foul
				language. If one of you is being cursed or annoyed, he
				should say: "I am fasting, I am fasting." This is related
				by Ibn Khuzaimah, Ibn Hibban, and al-Hakim. The latter
				said that it is sahih according to Muslim's criterion.
			</p>

				Abu Hurairah also reported that the Prophet, upon whom be

				These acts are allowed in general, but it is disliked to

			<p>
				Ibn Qudamah sums up the various opinions on the subject:
				"If while gargling or rinsing the nose for the sake of
				purifying one's self [for example, for prayer] water
				reaches the throat unintentionally and not due to
				exaggeration, there is no problem. This is according to
				al-Auza'i, Ishaq, and one statement from ash-Shaf'i,

				hold that it breaks the fast because that water reaches
				the stomach. If he was aware that he was fasting, it
				breaks his fast, as if he would have drunk intentionally.
				The first opinion is stronger, since [the water] reached
				the throat without intention or exaggeration. It is
				similar to having a fly enter the mouth and proceed to

				like putting pebbles into one's mouth provided it does
				not break into parts. If a part of it breaks off and
				enters the stomach, it will break the fast.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Taimiyyah says: "Smelling perfumes does not harm the
				fast." Enlarging upon the subject, he says: "As for kohl,
				injections, drops dropped into the urethra [that is,
				enemas for medicinal purposes], and treatment for brain
				and stomach injuries, there is some dispute among the
				scholars. Some say that none of these break the fast,
				some say that all except kohl would break the fast, while
				others say all except the drops break the fast, or that
				the kohl or drops do not break the fast but that the rest
				do." Ibn Taimiyyah continues: "The first opinion on this
				question is preferred. The most apparent conclusion is
				that none of them break the fast. The fast is part of the
				religion of Islam. Both the layman and specialist must be
				knowledgeable about it. If the preceding actions were
				forbidden by Allah and His Messenger to the fasting
				person because they would ruin the fast, then it would
				have been obligatory upon the Messenger to clarify that
				fact. If he had done so, his companions would have known
				about it and would have passed it on to the rest of the
				Muslims. Since no one has related that not from the
				Prophet, not with an authentic or a weak hadith, nor in
				mursal or musnad form then it must be the case that such
				acts do not void [the fast]." He also says: "If the
				ruling is one that would affect everyone or everyday
				matters, then the Prophet would have clarified it to a
				general audience. It is well-known that kohl was in
				common use as were oils, washing, incense, and perfume.
				If they broke the fast, the Prophet would have mentioned
				them, as he mentioned other things [that break the fast].
				Since he did not do so, they belong to the class of
				perfumes, incense, and dyes. Incense goes through the
				nose and enters the head and lands on the body. Dyes or
				oils are absorbed by the skin and the body is refreshened
				by it. The case of perfumes is similar. Since these have
				not been [explicitly] prohibited to the fasting person,
				it points to the fact that using them is permissible for
				the fasting person and so is kohl. The Muslims during the
				time of the Prophet would injure themselves, either from
				jihad or otherwise, and would injure their stomachs or
				skulls. If that would have ended their fasts, it would
				have been made clear to them [by the Prophet].
			</p>
			<p>
				Since that was not prohibited for the fasting person, it
				must not break the fast." Ibn Taimiyyah continues: "No
				one eats kohl and no one causes it to enter his
				stomach--neither through his nose nor through his mouth.
				Anal enemas are also not taken as food. Indeed, it helps
				the body to release whatever is in the intestines and it
				does not reach the stomach. Any medicine that is used to
				treat stomach wounds or head injuries [that is taken
				orally] is not considered similar to food. Allah says in
				the Qur'an: 'Fasting is prescribed for you as it was
				prescribed for those before you.' The Prophet, upon whom
				be peace, said: 'Fasting is a shield,' and, Verily, Satan
				rushes through the body like the flowing of the blood [in
				the body]. You should constrict his rushing by hunger and
				fasting.' To increase his Allah-consciousness a fasting
				person must not eat or drink because food and drink cause
				the veins to fill up with blood in which Satan circulates
				[in one's body]. They become easier for Satan through
				eating and drinking, not from enemas, kohl, or medicines
				applied through the penis or used to treat stomach and
				brain injuries."

					the fact that they were not ordered to make up
					that day."
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The only action, according to most scholars, which

				during a day of Ramadan.

			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that a man came to the Messenger of
				Allah and said: "I am destroyed, O Messenger of Allah!"
				The Prophet asked: "What has destroyed you?" He said, "I
				had intercourse with my wife during a day of Ramadan."
				The Prophet asked: "Are you able to free a slave?" He
				said, "No". The Prophet asked: "Is it possible for you to
				fast for two consecutive months?" He said, "No." The
				Prophet asked: "Is it possible for you to feed sixty poor
				people?" He said, "No." The Prophet said: "Then sit." A
				basket of dates was brought to the Prophet and he said to
				the man: Give this in charity. The man said: "To someone
				poorer than us? There is no one in this city who is
				poorer than us!" The Prophet laughed until his molar
				teeth could be seen and said: "Go and feed your family
				with it." This is related by the group.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most scholars say that both men and women have to perform
				the acts of expiation if they intentionally have
				intercourse during a day of Ramadan on which they had
				intended to fast. If they had intercourse out of
				forgetfulness or not due to choice--that is, due to
				coercion, or they did not have the intention to fast,
				then the expiation is not obligatory on either one of
				them. If the woman was forced to have intercourse by the
				man, the expiation will be obligatory only upon the man.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to ash-Shaf'i, the expiation is not obligatory
				upon the woman in any case--that is, regardless if it was
				due to choice or coercion, and she need only make up the
				day of fasting that she voided. An-Nawawi says: "The most
				authentic opinion, in general, is that the expiation is
				obligatory upon the man only and that there is nothing
				upon the woman. There is nothing obligatory on her in
				relation to this matter, as it is a matter of [paying]
				money [due to something related to] sexual intercourse
				and this refers to the duty of the man and not the woman.
				[In this way,] it is similar to the case of dowry."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Dawud says: "Ahmad was asked about someone who had
				sex during Ramadan: 'Is there any expiation upon the
				woman?' He said: 'I have not heard of any.' " In
				al-Mughni it is stated: "This refers to the fact that the
				Prophet ordered the man who had had sexual intercourse to
				free a slave. He did not order the woman to do anything,
				although he obviously knew that she was a partner in the
				act."
			</p>
			<p>
				According to most scholars, acts of expiation must be
				performed in the order that was mentioned in the hadith.
				The first command is to free a slave. If this is not
				possible, the person is to fast for two consecutive
				months. If that is not possible, the person is to feed
				sixty poor people with meals that are similar to an
				average meal in his household. The person cannot jump
				from one act to another unless he is not able to perform
				the prior order commanded. According to the Malikiyyah
				and a narration from Ahmad, the person is free to choose
				any of the above three acts and that will be sufficient
				for him.
			</p>
			<p>
				This latter opinion is based on the report from Malik and
				Ibn Juraij on the authority of Humaid ibn 'Abdurrahman
				who reported that Abu Hurairah narrated that a man broke
				his fast during Ramadan and the Prophet ordered him, as
				an expiation, to free a slave or fast two months
				consecutively or to feed sixty poor people. This is
				related by Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the preceding hadith, the word "or" implies choice,
				but according to some, the reason for the expiation to be
				performed was different and therefore the person could
				choose, as in the case of the expiation for breaking an
				oath. Ash-Shaukani says: "In the different narrations,
				there is evidence that the expiation is to be performed
				in order or according to one's choice. Those who relate
				it to be in order are more in number. Al-Muhallab and
				al-Qurtubi combined the narrations and said that the
				event [of someone breaking the fast] occurred more than
				once."
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Hafidh differs: "This is not correct. It was just one
				event and the parts are all united. So the crux of the
				matter is that there was not more than one event. Some
				combine the reports and say that following the order is
				preferred, but that one may choose. Others say the
				opposite."
			</p>
			<p>
				Whoever has sexual intercourse (with his wife) on a day
				of Ramadan and, before he performs the act of expiation,
				has intercourse on another day of Ramadan, need only
				perform one act of expiation according to a narration
				from Ahmad and the Hanafiyyah. This is because there is a
				punishment for acts that are repeated, and if the
				expiation or punishment is not carried out, all the acts
				are taken together as one. According to Malik,
				ash-Shaf'i, and Ahmad, the person must perform the
				expiation twice, as each day of Ramadan is a separate act
				of worship. If the expiation is obligatory because the
				person voided the fast, the separate acts are not
				combined together.
			</p>
			<p>
				All scholars agree that if the person intentionally had
				intercourse during a day of Ramadan and has performed the
				expiation and then has intercourse on another day of
				Ramadan, then another expiation becomes obligatory upon
				him. Similarly, they are in agreement that if one has
				intercourse twice during a day, before performing the
				expiation for the first act, then he need only perform
				one act of expiation. If he has performed the expiation
				for the first one, then he need not perform an act of
				expiation for the second, according to most scholars.
				Ahmad says that in such a case, he must perform a total
				of two acts of expiation.

		<section heading="Making Up Missed Days of Ramadan">
			<p>
				Making up missed days of Ramadan is an obligation that
				need not be fulfilled immediately because the time for
				fulfilling is very wide and one may perform it at any
				time. This is also the case with the fast of expiation.
				It has been authentically reported that 'Aishah would
				make up her missed days during the month of Sha'ban (the
				month preceding Ramadan), and that she did not perform
				them immediately even if she had the ability to do so.
			</p>
			<p>
				Observing the fast of Ramadan and making up the days are
				the same with respect to the fact that if one day of
				Ramadan is missed, then only one day needs to be made up.
				There is no additional penalty. They differ about the
				fact that when a person makes up the missed days he need
				not do so on consecutive days. This is because Allah
				says: "For him who is sick or on a journey, [the same]
				number of other days"--that is, whoever is sick or
				traveling and breaks the fast must fast the same number
				of days that he missed, consecutively or unconsecutively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Allah has ordered the fast in a general manner without
				any restricting clauses.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for making up the missed days of Ramadan, ad-Daraqutni
				recorded from Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet said: "If you
				wish, make them on nonconsecutive days and if you wish on
				consecutive days."
			</p>
			<p>
				If one delays performing the missed days of fasting until
				the next Ramadan comes, he is to fast the present Ramadan
				and then make up the days from the previous Ramadan.
				There is no ransom payment to be made, regardless of
				whether the person delayed the fasting due to some
				acceptable excuse or not. This is the opinion of the
				Hanafiyyah and al-Hassan al-Basri. Malik, ash-Shaf'i,
				Ahmad, and Ishaq agree that there is no ransom payment if
				the fasting was delayed due to some excuse, but they
				differ when the fasting was delayed without any
				acceptable excuse. In such a case, according to them, the
				person should fast the present Ramadan and then make up
				the days he missed from the previous Ramadan along with a
				ransom payment of a mudd of food given in charity each
				day. It should be noted that they have no acceptable
				evidence for that opinion. Apparently, the correct
				opinion is that of the Hanafiyyah, as there is no
				lawmaking without an authentic legal text to support it
				(that is, a Qur'anic verse or hadith).

			<p>
				The scholars agree that if an individual dies and has
				missed some prayers during his life, his guardian or heir
				is not to perform those prayers on his behalf. Similarly,
				if one does not have the ability to fast, no one is to
				fast for him while he is alive. There is a difference of
				opinion over the case of one who dies and has not made up
				some days of fasting although he had the ability to do
				so.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most scholars, including Abu Hanifah, Malik, and the
				Shaf'iyyah, say that the guardian or heir is not to fast
				on such a person's behalf, but is to feed one person a
				day for the missed days. The chosen opinion, however,
				among the Shaf'iyyah is that it is preferred for the
				guardian to fast on the deceased's behalf, thus
				fulfilling his duty. There is therefore no need for him
				to feed anyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				The meaning of guardian is near relative, whether it be
				an agnate or an heir or someone else. If a non-relative
				fasts for the deceased, it will only be valid if he got
				the permission of the guardian.
			</p>
			<p>
				The proof for the preceding is what Ahmad, al-Bukhari,
				and Muslim recorded from 'Aishah. The Messenger of Allah,
				upon whom be peace, said: "If one dies and has some fasts
				to make up, then his guardian' should fast on his
				behalf." Al-Bazzar added the words: "If he wishes to do
				so, while Ibn 'Abbas related that a man came to the
				Prophet and said: "O Messenger of Allah, my mother died
				and a month's fasting was due from her. Should I fast on
				her behalf?" The Prophet asked: "If your mother had a
				debt would you fulfill it for her?" He said, "Yes." The

				be fulfilled." This is related by Ahmad, atTirmidhi,
				an-Nasa'i, Abu Dawud, and Ibn Majah.

				All scholars agree on its legitimacy. The Prophet would
				perform i'tikaf for ten days every Ramadan. In the year
				that he died, he performed it for twenty days. This is
				related by alBukhari, Abu Dawud, and ibn-Majah. The
				Prophet's companions and wives performed i'tikaf with him
				and continued to do so after his death. Even though it is
				an act which is done to get closer to Allah, there is no
				sound hadith concerning its merits. Abu Dawud states: "I

				I'tikaf is of two types: sunnah and obligatory. The

				closer to Allah by following the actions of the Prophet,
				upon whom be peace, especially during the last ten days
				of Ramadan. The obligatory i'tikaf is that which the
				person makes obligatory upon himself. This may be done,
				for example, by an oath: "For Allah I must make i'tikaf,"
				or by a conditional oath: "If Allah cures me, I shall
				make i'tikaf ..." In Sahih al-Bukhari it is reported that
				the Prophet, upon whom be peace, said: "Whoever makes an
				oath to obey Allah should be obedient to Him." 'Umar
				said: "O Messenger of Allah, I made an oath to perform
				i'tikaf one night in the mosque at Makkah." The Prophet,

			<p>
				It can be fulfilled by staying in the mosque with the
				intention of making i'tikaf for a long or short time. The
				reward will be according to how long one stays in the
				mosque. If one leaves the mosque and then returns, he
				should renew his intention to perform i'tikaf. Ya'la ibn
				Umayyah said: "I secluded myself in the mosque for some
				time for i'tikaf." 'Ata told him: "That is i'tikaf, as
				long as you secluded yourself there. If you sit in the
				mosque hoping for good, it is i'tikaf. Otherwise, it is
				not." One who is performing the nonobligatory i'tikaf may
				end his i'tikaf at any time, even if it is before the
				period he intended to stay. 'Aishah related that if the
				Prophet intended to make i'tikaf, he would pray the
				morning prayer and begin it. One time he wanted to make
				i'tikaf during the last ten nights of Ramadan, and he
				ordered his tent to be set up. Aishah reported: "When I
				saw that, I ordered my tent to be set up, and some of the
				Prophets wives followed suit. When he [the Prophet]
				prayed the morning prayer, he saw all of the tents, and
				said: "What is this?" They said: "We are seeking
				obedience [to Allah and His Messenger]." Then he ordered
				his tent and those of his wives to be taken down, and he
				delayed his i'tikaf to the first ten days [of Shawwal]."
				The fact that the messenger of Allah ordered his wives'
				tents to be struck down and asked them to leave the
				i'tikaf after they have made the intention for it shows
				that they discarded the i'tikaf after they had begun it.
				The hadith also shows that a man may prevent his wife
				from preforming i'tikaf if she did not get his permission
				to perform it. There is a difference of opinion over the
				case of the man granting permission to his wife and then
				rescinding it. According to ashShaf'i, Ahmad, and Dawud,
				this is permissible for the husband, and the wife must
				leave her i'tikaf in such case.

				I'tikaf will be fulfilled if a person stays in the mosque
				with the intention of becoming closer to Allah. If the

				Certainly, i'tikaf must be done in the mosque, as Allah

		<section heading="The opinion of the jurists concerning the mosques in which the i'tikaf is to be performed">
			<p>
				There is a difference of opinion among the jurists
				concerning what mosques are acceptable for i'tikaf.
				According to Abu Hanifah, Ahmad, Ishaq, and Abu Thaur,
				i'tikaf is valid in any mosque in which the five prayers
				are held and which has a congregation. This is based on
				the hadith of the Prophet: "Every mosque that has a
				caller to prayer and an imam is acceptable for i'tikaf."
				This is related by ad-Daraqutni, but the hadith is mursal
				and weak and cannot be used as a proof.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malik, ash-Shafi, and Dawud say that it is acceptable in
				any mosque, as there is no proof that restricts it to any
				particular mosques. The Shaf'iyyah say it is better to
				perform i'tikaf in a congregational mosque, as the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, performed i'tikaf in such a
				mosque, and because the nwnber of those who attend the
				prayers in such a mosque is greater. If the period of
				i'tikaf includes the time for the Friday prayer, then one
				must perform it in the congregational mosque in order not
				to miss the Friday prayer.
			</p>
			<p>
				The person making i'tikaf may make the call to prayer if
				the place from whence the call is made is either the door
				of the mosque or its interior courtyard. He may also go
				to the roof of the mosque, as all of that is considered
				part of the mosque. If the place for the call to prayer
				is outside of the mosque, and the mu'takif makes the
				call, he will void his i'tikaf. The exterior courtyard is
				considered part of the mosque according to the Hanafiyyah
				and Shaf'iyyah and one narration from Ahmad. According to
				Malik and another narration, it is not part of the mosque
				and the person making i'tikaf should not go there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most scholars say that it is not correct for a woman to
				make i'tikaf in the mosque in her house (that is, the
				special place of her house where she performs her
				prayers) because the mosque in her house usually does not
				fall in the category of mosques and can be sold. There is
				no difference of opinion on this point. The wives of the
				Prophet always performed their i'tikaf in the Prophet's
				mosque.

		<section heading="I'tikaf, the Beginning and Ending of i'tikaf">
			<p>
				We have already mentioned that the voluntary i'tikaf does
				not have any specific time period. Whenever a person
				enters the mosque and makes the intention of becoming
				closer to Allah by staying there, he will be peforming
				i'tikaf until he leaves. If he has the intention to
				perform i'tikaf during the last ten days of Ramadan, he
				should begin it before the sun sets. Al-Bukhari records
				from Abu Sa'id that the Prophet, upon whom be peace,
				said: "Whoever makes i'tikaf with me is to make i'tikaf
				during the last ten [nights]." The ten refers to the last
				ten nights which begin on the night of the 20th or the
				21st.
			</p>
			<p>
				Concerning the statement that when the Prophet desired to
				make i'tikaf he would pray the morning and then go to the
				place of his i'tikaf, it means that he used to enter the
				place which he had prepared for his seclusion, but the
				actual time that he entered the mosque for his seclusion
				was during the beginning of the night.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Abu Hanifah and ash-Shafi, whoever performs
				i'tikaf during the last ten days of Ramadan must leave
				the mosque after sunset on the last day of the month.
				Malik and Ahmad say that it is acceptable to leave after
				sunset, but they prefer for the person to remain in the
				mosque until the time for the 'id prayer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-'Athram records from Abu Ayyub that Abu Qulabah would
				stay in the mosque on the night before the 'id prayer and
				would then go to the 'id prayer. During his i'tikaf, he
				had no mat or prayer carpet to sit on. He used to sit
				like anyone else. Abu Ayyub said: "I came to him on the
				day of 'id and on his lap was Juwairiyah Muzinah. I
				thought it was one of his daughters, but it was a slave
				that he had freed, and he came that way to the 'id
				prayer." Ibrahim said: "The people preferred that one who
				performed i'tikaf during the last ten days of Ramadan
				stay in the mosque on the night of 'id and then proceed
				to the 'id prayer from the mosque.
			</p>
			<p>
				If an individual makes a vow to perform i'tikaf for a
				specific period of days, or he wants to do so
				voluntarily, then he should begin his i'tikaf before dawn
				and leave when all the sun's light has gone, regardless
				of whether that be during Ramadan or at another time. If
				he vowed to perform i'tikaf for a night or a specified
				number of nights, or if he wants to do so voluntarily,
				then he should begin his i'tikaf before the sun has
				completely set and may leave when it is clear that dawn
				has begun. Ibn Hazm says: "The night begins when the sun
				sets and ends with dawn. The day begins with dawn and is
				completed by sunset. This is not a condition upon anyone
				unless he desires or intends to fulfill it. If one vows
				or wants to make i'tikaf voluntarily for a month, he
				should begin during the first night of the month. He
				should enter the mosque before the sun has completely set
				and may leave after the sun has completely set at the end
				of the month--regardless of whether it is Ramadan or
				otherwise."

		<section heading="What is preferred for the person who is fasting and what is disliked for him?">
			<p>
				It is preferred for the one who is making i'tikaf to
				perform many supererogatory acts of worship and to occupy
				himself with prayers, reciting the Qur'an, glorifying and
				praising Allah, extolling His oneness and His greatness,
				asking His forgiveness, sending salutations on the
				Prophet, upon whom be peace, and supplicating Allah--that
				is, all actions that bring one closer to Allah. Included
				among these actions is studying and reading books of

				upon whom be peace, books of fiqh, and so on. It is also
				preferred to set up a small tent in the courtyard of the
				mosque as the Prophet did.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is disliked for one to engage himself in affairs that
				do not concern him. At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah record on
				the authority of Abu Basrah that the Prophet said: "Part
				of a man's good observance of Islam is that he leave
				alone that which does not concern him." It is, however,
				disliked for a person to think that he can draw closer to
				Allah by not speaking. Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, and Ibn
				Majah record from Ibn 'Abbas that while the Prophet was
				delivering a speech, he saw a man standing and asked
				about him. The people said: "He is Abu Israel. He has
				vowed to stand and not to sit, and not to speak, and to
				fast." The Prophet said: "Order him to speak, go to the
				shade, to sit, and to complete his fast." Abu Dawud
				related from 'Ali that the Prophet said: "There is no
				orphanhood after one has passed the age of maturity, and
				there is no non-speaking for a day until the nightfall."

				It is good for the person performing i'tikaf to fast, but

				records from Ibn 'Umar that 'Umar said: "O Messenger of
				Allah, during the days of ignorance I vowed to perform
				i'tikaf one night in the mosque at Makkah. The Prophet
				said: 'Fulfill your vow.' " This statement of the

				night would not be valid. Sa'id ibn Mansur records that
				Abu Sahl said: "One of my wives was to perform i'tikaf,
				so I asked 'Umar ibn 'Abdulaziz about it. He said: 'She
				need not fast, unless she imposes it upon herself.'
				Az-Zuhri said: 'There is no i'tikaf save while fasting.'
				'Umar asked: 'Is this from the Prophet?' Az-Zuhri
				answered, 'No.' 'Umar asked, 'From Abu Bakr?' Az-Zuhri
				said,'No.' 'Umar asked [again], 'From 'Umar [ibn

				Al-Khattabi acknowledges [the differences on the issue]:

				The following acts are perrnissible for one who is making

			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The person may leave his place of i'tikaf to bid
					farewell to his wife. Safiyyah reported: "The
					Prophet was performing i'tikaf and I went to
					visit him during the night. I talked to him and
					then I got up to go. He got up with me and
					accompanied me to my house. (Her residence was in
					the house of Usamah ibn Zaid. Two men of the
					Ansar passed by them and when they saw the
					Prophet they quickened their pace.) The Prophet
					said: 'Hold on, she is Safiyyah bint Haya.' They
					said: 'Glory be to Allah, O Messenger of Allah
					twe did not have any doubt about you].' The
					Prophet, upon whom be peace, said: 'Satan flows
					in the person like blood. I feared that he might
					have whispered some [slander] into your heart.'"
					This is related by al-Bukhari, Muslim, and Abu
					Dawud.
				</li>
				<li>
					Combing and cutting one's hair, clipping one's
					nails, cleaning one's body, wearing nice clothes
					or wearing perfume are all permissible. 'Aishah
					reported: "The Prophet was performing i'tikaf and
					he would put his head out through the opening to
					my room and I would clean [or comb in one
					narration] his hair. I was menstruating at the
					time." This is related by al-Bukhari, Muslim, and
					Abu Dawud.
				</li>
				<li>
					The person may go out for some need that he must
					perform. 'Aishah reported: "When the Prophet
					performed i'tikaf, he brought his head close to
					me so I could comb his hair, and he would not
					enter the house except to fulfill the needs a
					person has." This is related by al-Bukhari,
					Muslim, and others.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Mundhir says: "The scholars agree that the one who
				performs i'tikaf may leave the mosque in order to answer
				the call of nature, for this is something that he
				personally must perform, and he cannot do it in the
				mosque. Also, if he needs to eat or drink and there is no
				one to bring him his food, he may leave to get it. If one
				needs to vomit, he may leave the mosque to do so. For
				anything that he must do but cannot do in the mosque, he
				can leave it, and such acts will not void his i'tikaf,
				even if they take a long time. Examples of these types of
				acts would include washing one's self from sexual
				defilement and cleaning his body or clothes from
				impurities."
			</p>
			<p>
				Sa'id ibn Mansur records that 'Ali said: "If a person is
				performing i'tikaf, he is to attend the Friday
				congregational prayer, be present at funerals, visit the
				ill and go to see his family about matters that are
				necesssary, but he is to remain standing [while visiting
				them]." 'Ali helped his nephew by giving him 700 dirhams
				to buy a servant and the nephew said: "I am performing
				i'tikaf ". 'Ali said: "What blame would there be upon you
				if you go to the market to buy one?" Qatadah used to
				permit the person who was performing i'tikaf to follow
				the funeral procession and to visit the sick, but not to
				sit while doing so. Ibrahim an-Nakha'i says that they
				preferred that the person who was performing i'tikaf do
				the following deeds and he was allowed to do them even if
				he did not do them to visit the sick, to attend the
				Friday prayers, to witness the funerals, to go out to
				meet his needs, and not to enter a place that has a
				ceiling. He said: "The one who is performing i'tikaf
				should not enter a roofed place unless there is a need to
				do so." Al-Khattabi says: "A group of people say that the
				person performing i'tikaf may attend the Friday prayer,
				visit the ill, and witness funerals. This has been
				related from 'Ali, and it is the opinion of Sa'id ibn
				Jubair, al-Hassan al-Basri, and an-Nakha'i." Abu Dawud
				records from 'Aishah that the Prophet would visit the
				sick while performing i'tikaf. He would visit them
				without steering away from his path. It has also been
				related from her that it is sunnah for the person not to
				leave his place of i'tikaf and visit the sick. This means
				that the person is not to leave his place of i'tikaf with
				the sole intention of visiting the sick, but if he passes
				by him, he may ask about him provided it is not out of
				his way.

				'tikaf will be nullified:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Intentionally leaving the mosque without any need
					to do so, even if it is for just a short time. In
					such a case, one would not be staying in the
					mosque, which is one of the principles of
					i'tikaf.
				</li>
				<li>
					Abandoning belief in Islam, as this would nullify

				</li>
				<li>
					Losing one's reason due to insanity or

					Sexual intercourse. Allah says: "But touch them

					devotions in the mosque."
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				However, one may touch his wife without there being any

				does not nullify it unless one ejaculates. Malik says
				that it nullifies the i'tikaf, for it is an illegal touch
				regardless of whether the person involved ejaculates or
				not. From ash-Shaf~i there are two reports that
				correspond to the two preceding opinions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Rushd explains that: "The reason for their
				differences of opinion is [the (fact) that] if a word has
				more than one meaning, one being literal and the other
				figurative, does the word apply at one time to all of
				them or not? This is one of the types of words that have
				more than one meaning. Those who say that it carries both
				meanings interpret 'touch' in the 'ayah . . . 'and touch
				them not and be at your devotions in the mosque' in the
				unrestrictive sense--that is, covering both sexual
				intercourse and also actions [of touching] that are less
				than that. Those who don't say it carries all of its
				meanings and they are the majority say that the 'ayah
				points to sexual intercourse or to touching that is less
				than intercourse. If we say that it refers to sexual
				intercourse by consensus, then this nullifies the
				possibility of it referring to actions less than
				intercourse, as one [single] word could not be taken in
				its literal and figurative meaning [at the same time].
				Those who say that what is less than sexual intercourse
				is included say so because it falls under the literal
				meaning of the verse. Those who differ do not take the
				word in its literal and figurative meaning at the same
				time.

				up that i'tikaf later. Some say that it is obligatory to
				do so.
			</p>
			<p>
				Writing on the subject, at-Tirmidhi says: "There is a
				difference of opinion about a person who ends his i'tikaf
				before his intended time has expired." Malik holds: "If
				he ends his i'tikaf [early], it is obligatory upon him to

				when the Prophet abandoned his i'tikaf, he made it up
				during the following month of Shawwal." Ash-Shaf'i
				states: "If he did not vow to perform i'tikaf or he did
				not make it obligatory upon himself, and then he left it
				early, he does not have to make it up unless he chooses
				to do so." He continues: "One does not have to undertake
				this act. If he did and then left it, he need not make it
				up [since it was voluntary], except for the case of hajj
				and 'umrah." Notwithstanding this, the imams agree that
				if one makes a vow to perform i'tikaf for a day or a

				If someone makes a vow to perform i'tikaf in the Masjid

				or in the Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem), he is to fulfill

				the Aqsa mosque, or this mosque."
			</p>
			<p>
				If someone vows to perform i'tikaf in another mosque, it
				is not obligatory on him to fulfill it and he may perform
				that i'tikaf in any mosque, for Allah did not specify any
				particular place for His worship, and there is no
				superiority of one mosque over another (with the
				exception of the three mosques mentioned earlier). It has
				been confirmed that the Prophet said: "A prayer in my
				mosque is superior to one thousand prayers in any other
				mosque but the Masjid alHaram, and a prayer in that

				hundred prayers."
			</p>

				We find in a sound hadith that the Prophet, peace be upon

				expertise is available, one should seek his or her
				treatment and not turn to anyone else. The same applies
				when one has to entrust a person with funds or deal with
				him in business. If a Muslim has to confide in or turn to
				someone from the people of the Book for medical
				treatment, he may do so. It is not prohibited to befriend
				Jews and Christians. And when the Muslim has an

				The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, prohibited the

				It is reported from Ibn Mas'ud that "once, when he

				The people said: 'O Abu Abdullah! We are familiar with
				incantations and amulets, but what is a love charm
				(altawlah)'?'He replied: 'It is a sort of magical formula

				' The man replied: 'I am suffering from weakness

				Allah and His Messenger, peace be upon him, encourage us
				to contemplate death and be ready for it with good deeds.
				This is regarded as a sign of goodness. Ibn ' Umar
				reports: "I came to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and I
				was the tenth of the first ten people (who embraced
				Islam). A man from among the Ansar got up and said: "O

			<p>
				It is makruh or "disliked" to wish for one's death, or
				pray to Allah for it, due to poverty, distress, illness,
				or the like. The six canonical compilers of hadith
				narrate on the authority of Anas that the Prophet, peace
				be upon him, said: "Let no one among you wish for death
				due to any hardship that may befall him. But if one has
				no other choice, but to do so, one should say: "O Allah!
				Grant me life as long as life is good for me, and cause
				me to die when death is better for me."
			</p>
			<p>
				The wisdom in the prohibition against wishing for death
				becomes obvious from a hadith narrated by Umm al-Fadl:
				"The Prophet, peace be upon him, went to see Al-'Abbas.
				He found him wishing for death. Thereupon the Prophet
				said: 'O Abbas! O Uncle of Allah's Messenger! Do not wish
				for death. If you do good and live long, your good deeds
				will multiply. Then that is better for you. If you are
				not good and your death is delayed, you may seek Allah's
				forgiveness. That is better for you. So do not wish for
				death'." (Narrated by Ahmad and Al-Hakim, who says it is
				sound according to Muslim's criteria)
			</p>
			<p>
				It is permissible, however, to wish for death, and there
				is no harm in doing so, when one fears persecution that
				puts one's faith at risk, as is indicated by the
				following supplication of the Messenger of Allah, peace
				be upon him: Allahumma inni as'aluka fi'lal khairat wa
				tarkal munkarat wa hubbal masakin wa an taghfarali wa
				tarhamani wa idha aradata fitnatan fi qaumi fatawafani

				Allah! I ask You for the means to do good, to avoid evil,
				and to love the poor, and I beseech You to forgive me and
				have mercy on me. When You subject my people to a trial,
				cause me to die without being affected by it. O Allah! I
				ask Your love, the love of those who love You, and the
				love of all such actions that bring one closer to Your
				Love."(Narrated by Tirmidhi who said it is a good and

				'Umar used to pray in these words: Allahumma kabirat

		<section heading="What Should be Done When Someone Dies">
			<p>
				It is sunnah to do the following when a person dies:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Advise the dying person to say: "La ilaha
					illa-Allah" (there is no god but Allah). It is
					narrated on the authority of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri
					that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said:
					"Prompt your dying people to say: 'La ilaha
					illa-Allah'." (Muslim, Abu Daw'ud, Tirmidhi)
					Another report on the authority of Mu'adh ibn
					Jabal states that the Messenger of Allah, peace
					be upon him, said: "He whose last words are 'La
					ilaha illa- Allah' shall enter Paradise."
					(Narrated by Abu Daw'ud; Al-Hakim considers it a
					sound hadith)
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This prompting (talqin) is necessary only when the dying
				person is unable to utter the shahadah (La ilaha illa-
				Allah . . . ). If such a person is able to utter these
				words then there is no need for prompting, but he should
				rather be advised to do so. Such advice is useful in
				cases of persons who are in possession of their faculties
				of reason and speech. If one is already mentally impaired
				such advice cannot be of benefit. But one who is unable
				to speak might say these words in his heart. The scholars
				are of the opinion that no pressure should be put on the
				dying person. So one should not say to him, "Say, 'La
				ilaha ill-Allah'," lest he should become annoyed and
				utter something improper. One may say the shahadah,
				however, in such a way that the dying person might be
				able to hear it and repeat it. If he utters it once, he
				should not be asked to repeat it unless he says some
				words after it. In such a case he should be asked to
				repeat shahadah to ensure that it be his last utterance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most scholars are of the opinion that one attending a
				dying person may repeat only the words: "La ilaha
				ill-Allah," according to the apparent meaning of the
				hadith. Others are of the opinion that the dying person
				should be prompted to utter the two testimonies (that is,
				"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I
				bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and
				Messenger"). The purpose is to remind him of the Oneness
				of Allah, which includes both of the two testimonies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad reported that Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, at the time of her death, turned
				toward the Ka'bah and placed her right hand under her
				head. This is the sleeping position recommended by the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, and in a grave, a dead body
				should also be placed in the same position. A report
				recorded from Ash-Shafi'i says: The body of the deceased
				should be laid flat on his back with his feet toward the
				Ka'bah, and his face raised a little, facing it. The
				majority of scholars, however favor the first position
				and hold it to be preferable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Hibban observes: This hadith refers to the recitation
				of Ya Sin for those on the eve of death and not for those
				already dead. This interpretation is supported by Ahmad,
				who recorded in his Al-Musnad that Safwan states: "The
				most eminent scholars say: 'The recitation of Surah Ya
				Sin at the time of a person's death makes death easy for
				him'. "The compiler of Musnad al-Firdaus attributes this
				hadith to Abu ad-Darda and Abu Dharr. They both narrated:
				"The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'If any person is
				on his deathbed and Ya Sin is recited to him, Allah makes
				his suffering easier'."
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a consensus among scholars regarding the
				permissibility of kissing a dead person. The Prophet,
				peace be upon him, kissed 'Uthman ibn Maz'un after his
				death. Similarly, when the Prophet died, Abu Bakr leaned
				over him and kissed him between his eyes saying: "O my
				Prophet! O my best friend! !"
			</p>
			<p>
				The guardian of the deceased should wash, wrap, and
				arrange for the burial of the body soon after the funeral
				prayer for the deceased, because the body might
				deteriorate if burial is delayed. This is based on a
				report, recorded by Abu Daw'ud from al-Husayn ibn Wujuh
				that when Talhah ibn al-Bara fell ill, the Prophet, peace
				upon him, said: "I see that Talhah is on the verge of
				death. Inform me about him (when he passes away) and make
				immediate preparations for his burial, for a Muslim's
				remains should not be left long with his family after his
				death."
			</p>
			<p>
				The burial may be delayed only for the guardian, provided
				no physical deterioration in the condition of the body is
				feared from such delay. Ahmad and Tirmidhi report on the
				authority of Ali ibn Abu Talib that the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said: "O Ali, never delay three things: prayer
				when its time approaches, the funeral when death is
				confirmed, and marrying a widow or a divorcee when a
				suitable match is found for her."
			</p>
			<p>
				This means that the judgement regarding a soul's
				salvation or perdition or its entry into Paradise is held
				in abeyance until its debts are fully paid off and
				settled. This applies to a person who leaves some
				property upon his death. His debt should be paid out of
				the property that he leaves behind. In the case of a
				person who dies in debt which he sincerely intended to
				pay, but has no property (nor leaves any behind to pay
				his debt), according to a confirmed report, his debt will
				be settled by Allah, the Exalted. Concerning a person who
				dies in debt with sufficient means to pay it and was
				willing to do so, but his heirs do not pay it, Bukhari
				records on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "If anyone takes other
				people's money with the intention to repay it and then he
				or she should die without settling the debt, Allah will
				pay the debt on his behalf. And if anyone takes money or
				property (of others) with the intention of destroying it,
				Allah will destroy him."
			</p>
			<p>
				A hadith recorded by Ahmad, Abu Nu'aym, Al-Bazzar, and
				At-Tabarani from the Prophet, peace be upon him, says:
				"The debtor will be summoned before Allah on the Day of
				Judgement. Then Allah will ask him: 'O Son of Adam ! Why
				did you incur debt and infringe on others ' rights? ' The
				man would reply: 'My Lord! You know I took it, but I
				neither abused nor lost it. It was stolen or bumed in a
				fire or lost its value.' Allah, the Almighty and Exalted,
				will say: 'My slave has told the truth, and I am more
				entitled (than anyone else) to settle his debt. Then
				Allah will issue a command and something will be placed
				on his scales causing his good deeds to outweigh his bad
				ones. And so, by Allah's Grace, he will enter Paradise'."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet, peace be upon him, did not perform funeral
				prayers for those who had died in debt. When, however,
				Allah the Almighty, granted him certain lands as a result
				of conquests, and the community's wealth increased, he
				offered funeral prayer for them and settled their debts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bukhari reports that the Messenger of Allah, peace be
				upon him, said: "I am nearer to the believers than their
				own selves. So if someone dies leaving behind debt, but
				no wherewithal to settle it, we shall pay his debt, and
				if someone dies and leaves some estate behind him, it is
				for his heirs (to pay his debt)."
			</p>
			<p>
				This hadith shows that the debt of a deceased Muslim may

				Allah will accept his prayer, grant him reward for his

			</p>
			<p>
				Tirmidhi reports from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari that the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "When a child of a
				servant of Allah passes away, Allah says to the angels:
				'Did you take the soul of My servant's child?' They say:
				'Yes.' He, the Almighty, says: 'Did you take away the
				apple of my servant's eye?' They say: 'Yes.' He, the
				Almighty says: 'What did My servant say at this?' They
				say: 'He praised You and said: "Inna lillahi wa inna

				The scholars consider it desirable that the deceased's

				Sittah on the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Prophet,

		<section heading="Weeping Over the Dead">
			<p>
				Muslim scholars are agreed that weeping for the dead is
				permissible, whereas crying and wailing are not. It is
				reported in a sound hadith that the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said: "Allah does not punish a person for
				shedding tears or feeling pain in his heart. But He does
				punish, though he may show mercy, because of (what he
				utters with) this," and then he pointed to his tongue.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet, peace be upon him, wept on the death of his
				son, Ibrahim, and said: "The eyes shed tears and the
				heart feels pain, but we utter only what pleases our
				Lord. O Ibrahim! We are aggrieved at your demise." He
				also wept when his grand daughter, Umaymah, daughter of
				Zainab, died. At this Sa'ad ibn 'Ubadah said: "O
				Messenger of Allah! Are you weeping? Did you not forbid
				Zainab from weeping?" The Prophet, peace be upon him,
				replied: "This (weeping) is the mercy that Allah has
				placed in the hearts of His servants. And surely Allah
				bestows mercy upon those who are merciful among His
				servants." A report is transmitted by At-Tabarani on the
				authority of Abdullah ibn Zaid to the effect that weeping
				without wailing is permitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Weeping aloud and wailing cause pain and suffering to the
				dead person. It is reported from Ibn 'Umar that when
				'Umar was stabbed and he became unconscious the people
				around him began crying loudly. When he regained
				consciousness he said to them: "Don't you know that the
				Messenger of Allah said: 'A dead person is tormented by
				the wailing of the living'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Musa reports that when 'Umar was wounded Suhaib
				cried: "O my dear brother!" At this 'Umar said: "O
				Suhaib! Don't you know that the Messenger of Allah said:
				'A dead person is tormented by the wailing of the living
				people'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Mughirah ibn Sh'ubah reports that he heard the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, saying: "The one who is
				wailed for is tortured on account of it." The above
				hadith are reported by Bukhari and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				These hadith mean that a dead person feels pain and
				displeasure when his family wails over him, for he hears
				their wailing and their deeds are shown to him. This does
				not mean that the dead are actually punished and
				tormented because of the wailing of their families for
				them, because the Qur'an says that a person is not
				accountable for the actions of others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Jarir reported from Abu Hurairah that he said: "Your

				good, they are pleased, and if these are bad, they
				despise them."

				Wailing refers to mourning in a loud voice and crying in
				a high pitch, which was prohibited by the Prophet, peace
				be upon him, . Abu Malik alAsh'ari reported that the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Four practices of the
				pre-Islamic days of Ignorance will continue to be
				practiced by my ummah: taking pride in one's parentage,
				giving a person a father other than his own genealogical
				father, believing that rain is caused by some stars, and
				wailing over the dead." He further said: "A
				(professional) mourner,  unless she repents before her
				death, will be raised on the Day of Judgement wearing a
				garment of tar and an armor of blistering puss." This is
				narrated by Ahmad and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				Umm 'Atiyyah reports: "The Messenger of Allah made us
				pledge that we will not wail over (the dead)" (Bukhari

				her clothes in mourning" (Bukhari and Muslim).

			<p>
				Ahmad narrates from Anas that he said: "The Prophet,

				their allegiance to him, not to mourn loudly for the
				dead. Thereupon they asked him, 'O Messenger of Allah,
				some women helped us (in mourning our dead) during the

				It is permissible for a woman to mourn for a period of
				three days on the death of a near relative, provided that
				her husband does not object to her doing so. It is not
				permissible for her to mourn for more than three days,
				except in the case of her husband's death, when she is to

				prescribed period of waiting or "iddah". This is reported
				by the group, (The compilers of the six most reliable
				hadith books generally known as Sihah Sitta) except

				Messenger of Allah said: "A woman should not mourn for
				any deceased person for more than three days, except in
				the case of her husband's death, which she may mourn for
				a period of four months and ten days. Such a woman (in
				mourning) is not to wear any (brightly) colored dress.
				She may wear only plain dress. During this period she
				should not use any adornment or eye makeup, nor wear any

				her hair, except at the end of her menstruation period,
				when she may use some cleaning or refreshing agents (such

				she must not use any adornment, such as jewelry, kohl, 58
				silk, perfume, or henna dye on her hands and feet. A
				widow must observe this waiting period in deference to
				her late husband's memory and to fulfill her obligations

		<section heading="Preparing Food for the Bereaved Family is Encouraged">
			<p>
				Abdullah ibn Ja'far reported that the Messenger of Allah,
				peace be upon him, said: "Prepare some food for the
				family of Ja'far, for what has befallen them is keeping
				them preoccupied." This is narrated by Abu Daw'ud, Ibn
				Majah and Tirmidhi, who grades it as a sound hadith.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet, peace be upon him, recommended this practice
				for it is an act of virtue and kindness and brings
				friends and neighbors closer to each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shafi'i said: "It is recommended that the relatives
				of the deceased prepare enough food to feed all the
				deceased's family for one day and night, for it is the
				sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and a practice
				of good people."
			</p>
			<p>
				The scholars hold it commendable to urge the deceased's
				family to eat so that their sorrow or excessive grief
				will not cause them to avoid food and thereby become
				weak. These scholars also hold that to offer food to the
				women while they are mourning loudly is not permissible,
				for it would be helping them in something sinful.
			</p>
			<p>
				All the schools of Islamic law disapprove of the
				deceased's family preparing food for the people coming to
				pay their condolences, for it adds to their grief and
				further encumbers them unnecessarily. Such a practice
				would also resemble the custom of the Arabs before Islam.
				Referring to this practice, Jarir says: "(In those days)
				we considered it a part of mourning to assemble at the
				deceased's house and prepare food after burial for those
				gathered there." Some scholars consider this to be
				absolutely forbidden (haram).
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Qudamah observes: 'It is permissible, however, when

		<section heading="Preparing the Kafan (Shroud) and Grave Before Death">
			<p>
				Bukhari deals with this subject in a chapter entitled:
				"Those Who Prepared the Kafan in the Prophet's Days
				without him objecting to it. Reporting on the authority
				of Sahl, Bukhari says: "A woman came to the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, with a woven piece of cloth that had
				two seams on its edges. She said: 'I wove it with my own
				hands in order to wear it. ' The Prophet, peace be upon
				him, took it because he needed it. He wrapped it around
				his waist so that it covered the lower half of his body,
				and he came toward us. A man praised it, saying: 'This is
				a very nice cloth! Why don't you give it to me to wear?'
				Some of the people present there reproached the man for
				they knew that the Prophet needed that cloth and that he
				never denied anyone's request. The man replied: 'By
				Allah, I asked him for it not to wear it, but to save it
				and use it as my kafan'." Sahl continues: "And (later
				when he died) that same piece of cloth was used as his
				kafan."
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on the above chapter of Bukhari, Al-Hafiz ibn
				Hajar says: "Bukhari phrased it so as to show that though
				(initially) the companions disliked the man's request for
				the cloth from the Prophet, they did not disapprove of it
				when he explained to them the reason for his request.
				This proves that it is permissible for a person to
				arrange during his lifetime for the things he will need
				after his death, such as a kafan or a grave." He cites
				Ibn Battal who said it is permissible to arrange for
				something before it is actually needed. Furthermore
				Al-Hafiz observes: "Some righteous people did indeed have
				their graves dug and prepared for them during their
				lifetime." Al-Zain ibn al-Munir criticized him, saying
				that the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him,
				did not do so, and that if doing so (preparing one's
				grave during one's lifetime) were desirable most of them
				would have done so.
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on this Al-'Aini says: "The fact that it was
				not done by the companions of the Prophet does not imply
				that doing so is not permissible, for if an act is deemed
				good by Muslims, then it is also good in the sight of
				Allah, especially when it is practiced by some of the

				The body of a martyr, that is, a Muslim killed in a

				His body should be enshrouded in the clothes he wore when
				he died if they are good enough for the purpose.
				Otherwise some additional cloth may be used to enshroud

				Ahmad reported: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, said:

			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shafi'i said: "Burying the martyrs without washing or

				It is said that the wisdom behind not offering a funeral

			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that Allah's Messenger, peace be

				They said: "O Allah's Prophet, he who is killed fighting

				Allah's cause is a martyr, he who dies in the cause of

		<section heading="A Disbeliever is not to be Washed">
			<p>
				It is not necessary for a Muslim to wash a disbeliever's
				body. Some scholars, however, consider it permissible.
				According to the Maliki and Hanbali schools, a Muslim may
				not wash a disbeliever' s body even if he is one of his
				near of kin. Similarly a Muslim is not permitted to
				shroud him or bury him unless it is feared that the body
				would decompose because of weather conditions, or that it
				would attract predatory beasts, etc. In such a case, he
				may be buried in a hole and covered with dust. This
				opinion is based on a tradition transmitted by Ahmad, Abu
				Daw'ud, Nasa'i and Al-Baihaqi on the authority of Ali who
				said: "I said to Allah's Messenger 'Your uncle, the old
				misguided man, has passed away. ' The Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said: 'Go and bury your father and do not do
				anything else until you return to me'." ' Ali said: "I
				did as he had told me and went back to him. The Prophet,
				peace be upon him, ordered me to take a bath, and then he
				prayed for me."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Mundhir says there is nothing specific reported
				from the Prophet, peace be upon him, about the procedure
				of washing the dead body.

		<section heading="Washing a Dead Body">
			<p>
				The entire body must be washed with water, at least once,
				regardless of whether the deceased is a male and needed a
				ritual bath, or a female who was menstruating at the time
				(of her death). It is recommended that the body be placed
				on an elevated surface i.e., a table or a board. It then
				should be stripped of clothes, but his 'awra (private
				parts) should be covered. (Ash-Shafi'i says that it is
				better to wash the body of the deceased wearing a shirt,
				if it is thin enough to let water reach the body. The
				Prophet, peace be upon him, was washed this way, but it
				was done only in his case. The common practice has been
				to cover the 'awra and wash the body) At the washing,
				only people whose presence is needed may stay.
			</p>
			<p>
				The washer, male or female, must be a trustworthy and
				pious person who will not broadcast what he or she might
				see except what is good.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Majah reports that the Prophet, peace be upon him,
				said: "Trustworthy persons should wash your dead." A
				washer must utter his or her intention to wash the body
				of a specific person. Then he should begin by lightly
				pressing the stomach of the deceased so as to expel, if
				possible, any remnants from it, and then wash the body of
				all impurities. The washer should use a wash cloth or
				wrap his or her hand with it, because touching the
				private parts of the dead is haram (forbidden). Then he
				or she should wash the deceased as in wudu (ablution) for
				the salah (obligatory prayers). The Prophet, peace be
				upon him, is reported to have said: "Begin washing the
				dead by washing organs on the right, and those parts that
				are washed in ablution." This is in order to crystalize
				the mark of the believer's parts of the body always
				washed during wudu that will shine forth brightly on the
				Day of Judgement. Then beginning from its right side, the
				body should be washed with soap and water, three times.
				If soap is not available, then washing with ordinary
				water will suffice. If the washer feels that three washes
				are not enough to cleanse the body properly, then he may
				wash it five or seven times. According to a sahih hadith,
				the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Wash the dead body
				an odd number of times, that is, three, five, or seven,
				or more if you feel it is necessary." (Ibn Abd al-Barr
				observes: "I know about no one who recommended more than
				seven washes." Ahmad and Ibn al-Mundhir disliked to
				exceed beyond seven)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Mundhir said: "The Prophet instructed the female
				washers to wash the dead body more than seven times in
				case they felt it was necessary to do so, but it must be
				an odd number of times. If the deceased is a female, then
				her hair should be loosened, washed, redone, and placed
				behind her back. According to a hadith narrated by Umm
				'Atiyyah the hair of the Prophet's daughter was done in
				three plaits. I asked: 'Did they loosen her hair and then
				redo them in three braids?' She said: 'Yes'." Muslim
				reports this in these words: "We braided her hair in
				three braids, on both sides and in front (of her)." In
				his Sahih, Ibn Hibban says: "They did so in compliance
				with the order of the Prophet: 'Do her hair in three
				plaits'."
			</p>
			<p>
				After having washed the body, it should be dried with a
				clean cloth lest the shroud should get wet. Then some
				perfume should be applied to it. The Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said: "When you apply perfume (to the dead),
				apply it an odd number of times after washing it." This
				is reported by AlBaihaqi, Al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban, of
				whom the last two consider it a sound hadith.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Wa'il said: "Ali had some musk, and he requested that
				it be applied to his body upon his death. This was of
				what was left from the perfume used on the body of the
				Prophet upon his death."
			</p>
			<p>
				The majority of scholars are of the opinion that clipping
				a deceased's finger nails, trimming his mustache, shaving
				the hair under his arms or from his private parts is
				makruh (disliked). Ibn Hazm, however, considers it
				permissible.
			</p>
			<p>
				The scholars are agreed that the body of the deceased be
				rewashed if the stomach excrete something (i.e., urine or
				stool) after it had been washed and prior to being
				shrouded. They differ, however, whether in such a case
				the entire body should be rewashed. Some hold that the
				body must be washed again in such a case. Others are of
				the opinion that there is no need to wash the whole body
				again, while still others hold that at least wudu
				(ablution) must be repeated in such a case. Some others
				hold that in such a case the entire washing must be
				repeated.
			</p>
			<p>
				The opinions of most scholars concerning washing of the
				dead are based on the hadith transmitted by the group on
				the authority of Umm 'Atiyyah who said: "The Prophet came
				to our house when his daughter died, and said: 'Wash her
				three times, five times, or more than that if you
				consider it necessary, with water and sidr (lotus tree
				leaves), and after the last wash apply some camphor to
				the body, and inform me after you have done so.' So when
				we finished washing we informed him. He gave us a cloth
				that he wore around his waist, and told us to wrap her in
				it as a first sheet of shroud."
			</p>
			<p>
				The reason for using camphor, as mentioned by some
				scholars, is its pleasant smell, since burial is a time
				when angels are present. Besides, it is cool and has a
				soothing effect, especially when the body stiffens, and
				helps keep various insects away from the body, thus
				preventing its early decomposition. In case camphor is
				not available, any other substance that has these or some
				of these properties may be used instead.

		<section heading="Cleaning the Body by Tayammum When Water is Unavailable">
			<p>
				If there is no water to wash the dead body, then it may
				be cleaned with tayammum (ablution with dust), for Allah
				says in the Qur'an: "If you do not find water, then
				perform tayammum (ablution with dust)." And the Prophet
				said: "The entire earth has been made pure and a mosque
				for me." Similarly if it is feared that the body might
				deteriorate if it is washed, then it may be given a
				tayammum.
			</p>
			<p>
				The same applies to a woman who passes away when there is
				no other woman around to wash her, or if a man dies and
				there are only women but no man to wash him. Abu Daw'ud
				in his collection of Marasil, and Al-Baihaqi on the
				authority of Makhul, report that the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said: "If a woman dies while she is with men
				and there is no other woman with them, or if a man dies
				while with woman, and there is no other man there, then
				the body of the dead person may be given a tayammum
				instead of washing it and then it should be buried. They
				both will be regarded as ones who died when there was no
				water available to wash (and purify)."
			</p>
			<p>
				The body of a woman shall be given tayammum by one of her
				mahrim consanguine relatives with his hand. If there is
				no consanguine relative present, then any other man can
				give her a tayammum by wrapping a piece of cloth around
				his hand. This is the opinion of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad.
				Malik and Ash-Shafi'i are of the view that "if a male
				relative of the deceased is available, then he should
				wash the body of the dead woman, for in matters of 'awrah
				('Awrah (Arabic), those parts of a person's body which
				must be covered. A man must cover the front and back of
				his pubic region. There is disagreement about the navel,
				thighs, and knees. There is, however, no disagreement
				over what constitutes a woman's 'awrah. Her entire body
				is 'awrah and must be covered, except her hands and face)
				(nakedness of the private parts) and being alone with a
				woman, she is considered and treated in such a case as a
				male person for him.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Al-Murawwa it is noted that Malik said: "I heard the
				scholars saying: 'If a woman dies and there is no other
				woman there to wash her, nor any male consanguine
				relative nor her husband who could undertake this
				responsibility, then she should be given a tayammum,
				wiping her face and hands with dry soil'." Malik said:
				"The same should be done in the case of a man who dies
				and there are only women around him." (Ibn Hazm holds
				that if a man dies while among women and there is no man
				around, or if a woman dies while among men with no other
				woman around, then the women may wash the body of the man
				and the men the body of the woman while covered in thick
				cloth. The water should be poured over the whole body
				without any physical contact. He is of the view that
				tayamm~m may not be given instead of a wash except when
				no water is available)

				In shrouding, the following practices are recommended and
				should be observed while preparing a body for burial.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The shroud should be nice, clean, and large
					enough to cover the entire body. This is based on
					a narration of Ibn Majah and Tirmidhi, who regard
					it a sound hadith from Abu Qatadah that the
					Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "If one of you
					is a guardian to his deceased brother, he should
					give him the best shroud he can."
				</li>
				<li>
					A shroud should be white, as it is recorded by
					Ahmad, Abu Daw'ud, and Tirmidhi on the authority
					of Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet, peace be upon
					him, said: "Wear white clothes, for these are
					your best clothes, and enshroud your dead in
					them." Tirmidhi considers it a sound hadith.
				</li>
				<li>
					The shroud should be scented and perfumed. The
					hadith is cited by Ahmad and by Al-Hakim, who
					regards it as sound, in accordance with Jabir's
					narration that the Prophet, peace be upon him,
					said: "If you perfume a dead body, do it three
					times." Abu Sa'id, Ibn 'Umar, and Ibn 'Abbas
					directed their heirs in their wills to perfume
					their shrouds with aloes-wood.
				</li>
				<li>
					The shroud should be three wraps for a man and
					five wraps for a woman, in light of what is
					narrated by the group from 'Aishah who said: "The
					Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, was
					wrapped in three pieces of new white sheets of
					cloth from Yemen, without a shirt or a turban."
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Tirmidhi said: "The majority of the scholars among the
				Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with
				them) and others hold this view." Sufyan Al-Thawri said:
				"A (deceased) male should be shrouded in three pieces of
				cloth, or a shirt and two loose pieces of cloth, or (if
				necessary) three wraps of cloth.
			</p>
			<p>
				One wrap may suffice if nothing else is available. Two
				wraps will also suffice, but three wraps are preferable
				for those who can afford it. This is the opinion of
				Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq. They hold that a deceased
				female should be enshrouded in five sheets.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is reported from Umm 'Atiyyah that the Prophet, peace
				be upon him, gave her a loincloth, a shirt, a scarf, and
				two pieces of cloth (to be used as a shroud for him). Ibn

			<p>
				If a pilgrim dies, he is to be washed the same way any
				non-pilgrim is washed. He should be shrouded in his ihram
				(two pieces of seamless cloth which the pilgrims don
				during umrah or hajj. His head should not be covered, nor
				should any perfume be applied to his body, because the
				restrictions of ihram still apply to him. This is based
				on what the group reported from Ibn 'Abbas, who said:
				"During the last hajj, a man, mounted on a horse, was
				close to Allah's Prophet, peace be upon him, and was
				trying to learn more from him, when he suddenly fell off
				his mount. The horse kicked him and killed him. When the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, was told about him, he said:
				'Wash him with water and lotus (leaves), then wrap him in
				his two sheets, and do not perfume his body nor cover his
				head, for Allah, the Exalted, will raise him on the Day
				of Resurrection with talbiyah (The prayer uttered during
				hajj by the pilgrims) on his lips'."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafi and Maliki schools hold that when a pilgrim
				dies, then his state of ihram is terminated, so that
				thereafter he may be shrouded like any nonpilgrim. His
				shroud may be sewn, his head may be covered, and he may
				be perfumed. In their opinion the case of the man who
				died while with the Prophet, peace be upon him, during
				the Hajj season is of a special case and does not set a
				precedent for other cases. Nevertheless the reason given
				(for not covering his head or perfuming his body . . )
				applies generally. The statement that he will be raised
				on the Day of Judgement with talbiyah on his tongue
				clearly applies to all who die in the state of ihram,
				because it is a well established juristic principle that
				a ruling true for one case is also true and applicable to
				other similar cases, unless there is something indicating
				that the case is specific in nature and limited in scope.

				that there is no fixed time for offering it. It may be
				offered at any time, including the times when regular
				prayers may not be offered. This is the opinion of the
				Hanafi and Shafi'i schools. Ahmad, Ibn Al-Mubarak, and
				Ishaq dislike offering a funeral prayer at sunrise, at
				noon when the sun is at its zenith, and at dusk when the
				sun is about to set, except in cases when it is feared
				that if delayed, the body might decompose.

		<section heading="Main Requirements of the Funeral Prayer">
			<p>
				Certain requirements must be met for a valid funeral
				prayer, and failure to meet any of these may invalidate
				the prayer. These requirements are given below:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Intention
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The real intention is what is in the heart, and its
				verbal utterance is not legally required. Allah says in
				the Qur'an: "And they have been commanded no more than
				this: To worship Allah, offering Him sincere devotion,
				being true in (faith)." Qur'an 98.5 And the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, said: "Verily, all deeds (of a person)
				will be judged in the light of the intentions behind
				them, and every person will attain what he intends."
			</p>
			<p>
				The majority of scholars regard it as an essential
				condition for a valid funeral prayer to stand while
				praying if one is physically able to do so. A funeral
				prayer offered while sitting or riding, without any valid
				excuse, is not valid.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is reported in Al-Mughni "It is not permissible for
				one to offer a funeral prayer while riding, as in this
				case an essential condition - standing while praying -
				would be missing." This is the opinion of Abu Hanifah,
				Ash-Shafi'i, and Abu Thaur. There is no difference on
				this point. It is preferable to put one's hands together,
				placing the right on the left, as is done in the
				prescribed regular prayer. Some disagree, but in our view
				it is better and preferable.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is based on a report transmitted by both Bukhari and
				Muslim on the authority of Jabir who said: "Allah's
				Messenger, peace be upon him, offered funeral prayers for
				Najashi (Negus) and said four takbirs. (That is, he said
				Allahu akbar four times)
			</p>
			<p>
				Tirmidhi said: Most of the learned Companions of the
				Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them) and others
				followed and acted in accordance with the above example
				of the Prophet. They hold that four takbirs should be
				said in a funeral prayer. Among these scholars are
				Sufyan, Malik, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and
				Ishaq.

				It is sunnah to raise one's hands while uttering the
				first takbir. There is nothing related from the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, to show that he raised his hands in
				funeral prayer except for the first takbir. Ash-Shawkani
				mentions various opinions about takbirs and the arguments
				for them and says: "In short nothing except the first
				takhir is reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him.
				The acts and sayings of the Companions of the Prophet
				(may Allah bless them) by themselves do not constitute a
				conclusive argument. Therefore one should raise one's
				hands only on saying the first lakhir. For the rest of
				the (three) takbirs no such instruction is available,
				except when one changes from one posture to another as in
				the regular prayer. There is no such change of posture
				required in the funeral prayer, so there is no need for
				raising hands in other than the first "takbir".

				Ash-Shafi'i has in his Musnad narrated from Abu Umamah
				ibn Sahl that one of the Companions of the Prophet (may
				Allah be pleased with them) told him that when offering a
				(funeral) prayer it is sunnah for the imam to say aloud
				Allahu Akbar (first opening takbir), then to recite
				al-Fatihah silently in his heart, and then send
				salutations to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and then
				pray for forgiveness of the deceased. Nothing else is to
				be recited in between takbirs. Finally, he should end his
				prayer with salutations in his heart. (According to the
				majority of scholars, reciting al-fatihah, sending
				blessings upon the Prophet, supplicating for the
				deceased, and salutations are sunnah. In the case of the
				imam, however, it is sunnah to utter the takbir and
				salutations aloud in order to communicate with those
				praying with him) The author of Al-Fath says: "The chain
				of narrators of this hadith is sound."
			</p>
			<p>
				Bukhari reported from Talha ibn Abdullah that he said: "I
				offered a funeral prayer that was led by Ibn Abbas. He
				recited Al-Fatihah and said: 'This is a sunnah of the
				Prophet, peace be upon him."' Tirmidhi also reported this
				and remarked that this has been the practice of some of
				the learned among the Companions of the Prophet (may
				Allah be pleased with them). Others prefer to recite
				Al-Fatihah after the first takbir. This is the opinion of
				Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, and Ishaq. Some others hold that
				Al-Fatihah is not to be recited in a funeral prayer. The
				funeral prayer should consist of praise for Allah
				(thana), blessings (salawat) upon the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, and a prayer (du'a) for forgiveness of the
				deceased. This is the opinion of Al-Thawri and other
				scholars of Kufah. Those who hold the recitation of
				al-Fatihah in a funeral prayer obligatory argue that the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, called it a prayer (salat)
				when he said: "Offer prayer (sallu) for your deceased
				friend." And as no prayer can be complete without
				al-Fatihah, for the Prophet, peace be upon him, also told
				us "no prayer is valid unless al-Fatihall is recited in

					from among the Muslims. I heard him saying:
					Allahumma inna fulana ibna fulan fi dhimatika wa

				All jurists with the exception of Abu Hanifah are in

				the view that they are required, but not obligatory as a

				the funeral prayer is a prayer (salah), and as such it
				cannot be terminated except by salutations (to the right

			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Mas'ud said: "Salutations at the end of a funeral
				prayer are similar to those said at the end of any formal
				prayer. The minimum that would suffice in this respect is
				to say: "As-Salamu 'Alaikum" or "salamun 'alaikum" (the
				peace be with you or peace be with you)."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad is of the opinion that one salutation - the
				salutation to the right - is sunnah, and there is no harm
				if one says it while looking straight ahead. This is

				and his Companions who ended their funeral prayer with
				one salutation. No difference of opinion among them is on

				Ash-Shafi'i holds that two salutations, turning one's

				and it is entitled to its share of inheritance."
				According to this hadith offering a funeral prayer for a
				miscarried fetus is conditioned upon proof of its life
				evident in signs of life, such as its movement, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad, Sa' id, Ibn Sirin, and Ishaq are of the opinion

				The words used in this hadith are "a funeral prayer
				should be offered for a miscarried fetus" because it has
				a soul and is alive. The Prophet, peace be upon him,
				informed us that a fetus receives a soul when it is four
				months old. Others refute this argument with the

			<p>
				A martyr is one who is killed in a battlefield fighting
				the enemies of Islam. All the hadith on this subject are
				quite explicit that no funeral prayer may be offered for
				a martyr.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bukhari has narrated from Jabir that the Prophet, peace
				be upon him, ordered that the martyrs of the battle of
				Uhud be buried while they were still bleeding. He neither
				washed them nor offered a funeral prayer for them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad, Ahu Daw 'ud and Tirmidhi reported that Anas said:
				"The martyrs of Uhud were not washed. They were buried
				with their wounds unwashed, and no funeral prayer was
				offered for them."
			</p>
			<p>
				There are, however, some hadith that are equally explicit
				and state that a funeral prayer should be offered for
				martyrs. Bukhari reported from 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir that one
				day the Prophet, peace be upon him, went out and offered
				a funeral prayer for the martyrs of Uhud, eight years
				after their death, as if he were bidding farewell to both
				the living and the dead.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Malik Al-Ghafari reported: "The bodies of the martyrs
				of Uhud were brought in batches of nine and placed with
				the body of Hamzah, who served as the tenth. Then the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, offered a funeral prayer for
				them. After that the nine bodies were removed leaving
				Hamzah undisturbed. Then a batch of another nine martyrs
				was brought and placed beside Hamzah. The Prophet, peace
				be upon him, offered a funeral prayer for them as well.
				This way the Prophet offered funeral prayer for all of
				them. This hadith has been narrated by Al-Baihaqi, who
				says: "This is the most sound hadith on this subject. It
				is, however, a mursal hadith. (Mursal: A hadith that
				rests on a chain of authonties going no further back than
				the second generation after the Prophet (peace be upon
				him))
			</p>
			<p>
				The difference in the narrations in these various hadith
				has led jurists to differ on this matter. Some take all
				of them together, while others prefer some narrations
				over others. Ibn Hazm holds that either--offering or not
				offering (funeral prayer for the martyrs)--is
				permissible. It is alright whether or not a funeral
				prayer is offered for the martyrs. In one of his
				statements Ahmad has also expressed a similar view. Ibn
				al-Qayyim approves of this view and says: "The correct
				position in this regard is that one is given a choice
				whether or not to offer a funeral prayer (for a martyr),
				because there are reports in favor of both positions."
				This is the opinion also of Ahmad, and he is the proper
				person to describe the principles of his school. He says:
				"What is apparent from this is that no funeral prayer was
				offered for the martyrs of Uhud before burying them.
				There were seventy people who fell martyrs in that
				battle, and any funeral prayer for them could not have
				taken place in secret."
			</p>
			<p>
				The hadith reported by Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah that the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, did not offer funeral prayer
				for these martyrs is sound and very explicit. Jabir' s
				father was among those who were killed that day, and he
				knew what few besides him knew.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah, Al-Thawri, Al-Hasan, and Ibn Al-Musayiyaib,
				however, are inclined to the reports stating that the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, did offer funeral prayer for
				the martyrs. They hold that a funeral prayer must be
				offered for martyrs. However, Malik, Ash-Shafi'i, Ishaq,
				and, according to one report, Ahmad, prefer the reports
				that say no funeral prayer is to be offered for martyrs.
				Ash-Shafi'i in his Kitab al-Umm writes: "All reports
				received concerning this subject are sound and show that
				the Prophet, peace be upon him, did not offer funeral
				prayer for the martyrs of Uhud. Those who report that he
				offered funeral prayer for them and said seventy takbirs
				for Hamzah are not correct. Those who turn away from
				these sound hadith should be ashamed of themselves. The
				hadith reported by 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir also states that the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, did so eight years after
				their death, as if he were bidding them farewell. This
				does not constitute abrogation of an established
				practice. (See Al-Umm. by Ash-Shafi'i)

				If one is wounded in a battle, but survives, remains in a

				was taken to the mosque, where he remained for a few

				If on the other hand, a wounded fighter does not survive

				The majority of Muslim scholars are of the opinion that a
				funeral prayer may be offered for a person who is
				convicted of embezzlement of public funds, or commits
				suicide or some similarly sinful act.
			</p>
			<p>
				An-Nawawi said: "Al-Qadi said: 'All Muslim scholars hold
				that a funeral prayer be offered for all Muslims - those
				sentenced to death under Islamic law, or stoned to death,
				or those who committed suicide, or were born out of
				wedlock. The reports about the Prophet, peace be upon

				suicide may be explained perhaps by considering such
				refusal to be a form of reprimand to these people. This
				is similar to his practice of refusing to pray for those
				who died in debt, though he asked other Muslims to offer
				the funeral prayer for them'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Hazm said: "Funeral prayer should be offered for all
				Muslims, whether good or bad, including those sentenced
				to death and those that die fighting or in revolt. The
				imam, or any one other than him, may lead the funeral
				prayers. Likewise funeral prayers should be said for an
				innovator, provided his innovation does not become
				blasphemy, and prayer may also be said for one who
				commits suicide or kills some one else. A funeral prayer
				may be offered in all such cases even though the deceased
				might have been the most evil person on the face of the
				earth, provided he dies as a Muslim. This is based on a
				hadith from the Prophet, peace be upon him, that has a
				general bearing. "Offer a funeral prayer for your friend
				(a fellow Muslim)," he is reported to have said on the
				death of a Muslim. All Muslims are friends to one
				another. The Qur'an says: "Verily! The believers are but
				a single brotherhood" Qur'an 49.10 and "The believers,
				men and women, are protectors, one of another." Qur'an
				9.71
			</p>
			<p>
				To prevent others from offering funeral prayers over a
				Muslim is a most serious thing, for surely a sinful
				Muslim is more in need of prayers from his Muslim
				brothers than a pious and saintly person!
			</p>
			<p>
				An authentic hadith records that a man died in Khayber,
				and the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Offer a
				funeral prayer for your friend. He has stolen something
				of the war booty." The Muslims searched the deceased's
				personal effects and found less than two dirham worth of
				beads in them.
			</p>
			<p>
				In another sahih hadith 'Ata reported that a funeral
				prayer may be offered for an illegitimate child, and his
				mother, and for those who curse each other, (In cases of
				Lu'an, for instance, when in the absence of any evidence
				of a spouse's adultery both the man and wife are required
				to swear an oath that he/she is telling the truth or face
				being cursed by Allah if they were lying) as well as the
				person who is killed in requital, and the person stoned
				to death, and the person who flees from the battlefield
				and is put to death for it. ' Ata said: "I will never
				abstain from offering a funeral prayer for a person who
				says: 'I bear witness that there is no deity except
				Allah.' Allah says: 'It is not fitting for the Prophet

			</p>
			<p>
				Another authentic hadith says that Ibrahim An-Nakh'i
				said: "Our predecessors never eschewed attending a
				funeral prayer for any Muslim. They offered the funeral
				prayer for those who had committed suicide, and it is a
				sunnah to offer funeral prayer for those who are stoned
				to death." In another sound hadith Qatadah reported: "I

				It is permissible to offer funeral prayer for a deceased
				anytime after his burial, even if a prayer was offered
				prior to his burial. As mentioned above, the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, offered funeral prayer for the martyrs
				of Uhud after eight years. Zaid ibn Thabit reported:
				"Once we went out with the Prophet, peace be upon him .
				When we reached al-Baqi ' (Famous cemetery in Madinah,
				where a large number of the Prophet's companions are
				buried) we noticed a newly dug grave. The Prophet, peace
				be upon him, asked about it and was told that was the
				grave of such and such a woman. At this he said: 'Why did
				you not inform me of her death?' They replied, 'O Prophet
				of Allah! You were fasting and were resting at the time
				and we did not want to bother you. ' He said: 'Do not do
				that again. So long as I am with you, make sure you
				inform me when any one among you dies, for my prayers for
				the deceased is a mercy for them.' Then the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, went to the grave. We stood in rows
				behind him and he offered a funeral prayer for her with
				four takbirs." This hadith has been reported by Ahmad,
				Nasa'i, Al-Baihaqi, Al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban. The last two
				reporters regard it as a sound hadith.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tirmidhi said: This has been the practice of most of the
				scholars, the Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be
				pleased with them), as well as others. Ash-Shafi'i,
				Ahmad, and Ishaq hold the same view. This hadith also
				shows that the Prophet, peace be upon him, offered
				funeral prayer at a grave when a funeral prayer had
				already been offered by his Companions for the deceased
				before her burial, for they could not bury her without a
				funeral prayer. From this hadith it is also obvious that
				praying for the dead (before the burial) was a common
				practice of the Companions, and was not limited only to
				the Prophet, peace be upon him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Al-Qayyim said: "These proven traditions of the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, do not contradict the sound
				hadith that reports the statement of the Prophet, peace
				be upon him: 'Do not sit by the graves, or offer prayer
				facing them.' This is a sound hadith that bids us not to
				sit or pray at the graves. What is forbidden is to offer
				formal prayer (salah) facing a grave. Offering a funeral
				prayer at the grave is not forbidden, for funeral prayer
				does not have to be offered at any specific place. It is
				rather better offered outside a mosque than inside it.
				The funeral prayer at the grave is similar to offering it
				beside the coffin. In either case the prayer is offered
				for the deceased, and his body, whether it is in the
				coffin or in the grave, remains in the same position.
				Offering prayers other than funeral prayers are forbidden
				at graves, for there is a risk that this may tum these
				graveyards into mosques, against which the Prophet, peace
				be upon him, wamed us. He cursed those who tum graves
				into places of worship, saying: 'Some evil people will be

				A certain etiquette is recommended while walking in a
				funeral procession or carrying a coffin:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Carrying a coffin and accompanying it to the
					graveyard is recommended. According to the sunnah
					it is preferable to go all around the coffin
					while carrying it. Ibn Majah, Al-Baihaqi, and Abu
					Daw'ud At-Tayalisi report that Ibn Mas'ud said:
					"If one walks in a funeral procession and carries
					the coffin, one should do so from all the sides
					of the coffin, for this is a sunnah of Prophet,
					peace be upon him." But this is optional. Abu
					Sa'id reported that the Prophet, peace be upon
					him, said: "Visit the sick, and follow the
					funeral procession, for it will (help) remind you
					of the Hereafter." This was narrated by Ahmad
					with a sound chain of narrators.
				</li>
				<li>
					A funeral procession must proceed at a fast pace.
					The group reported on the authority of Abu
					Hurairah that the Prophet, peace be upon him,
					said: "Walk briskly while carrying a coffin, for
					if the deceased is righteous, you would be taking
					it to something better, and if he or she is an
					evil person, then you will be getting him or her
					off your necks." Ahmad, Nasa'i, and others
					reported that Abu Bakrah said: "If you had seen
					us following a funeral procession along with the
					Prophet, peace be upon him, you would have
					thought that we were jogging." Bukhari reported
					in his book on History that, when Sa'd ibn Mua'dh
					died, the Prophet, peace be upon him, walked at
					such a fast pace behind his funeral that our
					shoes came apart."
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The author of Al-Fath said: "In short, it is preferable
				to walk fast in a funeral, but this should not harm or
				affect the coffin or put to hardship those carrying the
				coffin or following it, because that would defeat the
				Islamic goal of promoting hygiene and avoiding placing
				undue hardship on other Muslims." Al-Qurtubi said: "This
				hadith means that people should not delay the burial,
				because such a delay is often the result of arrogance and
				vanity.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafi school holds that walking behind a funeral is
				preferable, as is indicated from the words of the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, concerning following a
				funeral.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anas ibn Malik is of the opinion that one may walk
				anywhere in a funeral procession, as mentioned above in
				the hadith of the Prophet, peace be upon him: "A rider
				should ride behind the funeral, whereas one on foot may
				walk behind it, or in front of it, or to its right side
				or left side, or close to it." Apparently there is no
				hard or fast rule in this regard, and the difference of
				opinion in this regard is quite legitimate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abdur Rahman ibn Abza reported that Abu Bakr and 'Umar
				used to walk in front of a funeral, while 'Ali walked
				behind it. When told that Abu Bakr and 'Umar were walking
				in front of the funeral, 'Ali remarked: "They both know
				that walking behind a funeral is better than walking in
				front of it, just as the prayer of a person in
				congregation (jama'ah) is better than the prayer of one
				offering it alone. But Abu Bakr and 'Umar did so in order
				to make it easy for others." This was narrated by
				Al-Baihaqi and Ibn Abu Shaibah. Al-Hafiz said its chain
				of authorities is sound.

				Riding behind the funeral, without a valid excuse, is
				disliked in the opinion of the majority of scholars.
				Doing so after the burial, is not disliked, however, and
				is quite acceptable, as indicated by a hadith narrated by
				Thawban, which says that the Prophet, peace be upon him,
				was brought a mount to ride during a funeral, but he
				declined. But, when he returned after the burial and was
				offered a mount, he rode on it. They asked him about this
				(why he declined to mount during the funeral procession)
				and he replied: "Verily, the angels were walking with the
				funeral, so I did not like to ride while the angels were
				walking. But, when the angels left, I rode the mount."
				This was narrated by Abu Daw'ud, Al-Baihaqi, and
				Al-Hakim, who said this hadith is sound according to the
				criterion of Muslim and Bukhari. Tirmidhi narrated that
				the Prophet, peace be upon him, walked with the funeral
				of Ibn Ad-Dahdah, but on his way back he rode on
				horseback. According to Tirmidhi this is a sound hadith.
			</p>
			<p>
				This hadith does not contradict the other hadith in which
				the Prophet, peace be upon him, is reported to have said:
				"A rider must stay behind a funeral," since this may
				imp!y that such an act is disliked, though permissible.
				The Hanafi school holds that there is no harm in riding,
				although it is better to walk unless for some valid
				reason one is unable to do so. And in light of the above
				hadith a rider should stay behind the funeral procession.
				Al-Khattabi said: "I know of no difference of opinion
				amongst scholars on the point that a rider should stay
				behind a funeral procession."

				It is desirable to encourage those attending the burial
				to throw three handfuls of soil over the grave from the
				head of the body. This is based on a hadith by Ibn Majah
				which says: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, once offered
				a funeral prayer and then went to the deceased's grave
				and threw three handfuls of soil from near the deceased's
				head." Abu Hanifah, Ash-Shafi'i, and Ahmad hold that when
				throwing the first handful one should say, "Of this (i.e.
				the earth) We created you," and on the second one should
				say, "And to it shall We cause you to return," and on the
				third handful one should say, "And of it We shall cause
				you to be resurrected a second time." This is based on a
				hadith that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said this
				when his daughter Umm al-Kulthum was laid in her grave.
				Ahmad said: "Nothing is required to be said while
				throwing handfuls of soil over the grave because this is
				a weak hadith.

				After the burial, it is desirable to pray for forgiveness
				of the deceased and acceptance (of his conduct by Allah),
				because at this time he is being questioned about his
				life. It is reported by 'Uthman: "After burial the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, would stand by the grave of
				the deceased and say: "Seek forgiveness for your brother
				and pray for his acceptance, because he is now being
				questioned about it." (This hadith is reported by Abu

				Al-Bazzar says: "This is the only report from the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) on this subject.) Ruzain reported:
				"After the deceased was buried 'Ali used to pray: 'O
				Allah! This is Your servant, who is now a guest of Yours,
				and You are the best host. Forgive him, and expand the

				Ash-Shafi'i and some other scholars prefer that a

				is based on a report by Sa' id ibn Mansur from Rashid ibn
				Sa'd and Damarah ibn Habib and Hakim ibn 'Umair. They
				said: "After the grave is leveled and the people leave,
				one should stand by the grave and say three times to the
				deceased: 'O so-and-so, say: "There is no god but Allah,
				I bear witness that there is no god but Allah",' 'O
				so-and-so, say: "Allah is my Lord, Islam is my din, and

				in his book Al-Talkhis. At-Tabarani reported that Abu
				Amamah said: "When one of your brethren passes away and
				you have leveled the ground over his grave, you should
				stand by the grave's head and say: 'O so-and-so, son of
				so-and-so,' for the deceased will hear him, but he cannot
				respond. Then he should say 'O so-and-so, and son of
				so-and-so, whereby the deceased will sit up in his grave.
				Then he should say: 'O so-and-so, son of so-and-so, at
				which the deceased says: "Guide me, may Allah be merciful
				to you,' but you cannot hear him. Then he should say to
				the deceased: 'Remember the faith with which you left
				this world, and remember to bear witness that there is no
				god but Allah and Muhammad is His servant and Messenger,
				and remember that you have accepted Allah as your Lord,
				Islam as your religion, Muhammad as your Prophet and the
				Qur'an as your guide. ' At this Munkar and Nakir (the two
				angels appointed to question the people in the graves)
				will hold each other's hand and say: 'Let us go! Why
				should we sit for a person who has been taught this."' A
				man asked: "O Allah's Messenger! What if one did not know
				the name of the deceased's mother?" The Prophet, peace be
				upon him, replied: "In such a case, one should call him
				by his first mother, Eve, and say: 'O so and so, O son of
				Eve).'' (Al-Hafiz in his book Al Talkhis said that the
				chain of narrators of this hadith is sound. Ad-Diaya' in
				his Al-Ahkam has also described it as a sound hadith.
				There is in its chain of narrators one called 'Asim ibn
				Abdullah who is a weak narrator.) Haithami refers to this
				hadith and says there are some narrators in its chain
				whom he did not know as trustworthy.
			</p>
			<p>
				An-Nawawi said: "The above hadith, even if it is a weak
				one, would be considered a source of reference. The
				scholars of hadith and others agree that in matters such
				as virtue, exhortation to good, and waming against evil,
				even the weak hadith are admissible. The above hadith is,

				in which the Prophet, peace be upon him, is reported to

				Another is the hadith about the will made by 'Amr ibn

		<section heading="The Sunnah Concerning Graveyards">
			<p>
				The sunnah is to raise the grave at least one hand above
				the ground so it is known that it is a grave. It is
				forbidden to raise it more than that. This is based on a
				narrative reported by Muslim and others from Harun that
				Thamamah ibn Shufayy told him: "Once we were with Fadalah
				bin 'Ubayd in the Roman land of Brudis. One of our
				companions died and upon burying him we were ordered by
				Fudalah ibn 'Ubayd to level his grave. Then Fudalah said:
				'I heard Allah's Messenger, peace be upon him, ordering
				people to level the graves of the deceased." It is
				reported from Abul al-Hayaj al-Asadi who said 'Ali bin
				Abu Talib told me: "Should I not instruct you to do as
				the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, instructed me?
				Do not leave a statue standing without removing it. Do
				not leave a grave raised without leveling it."
			</p>
			<p>
				Tirmidhi said: "Some scholars act upon this opinion. They
				disapprove of raising the grave more than necessary to
				indicate that it is a grave, and so people will not step
				or sit on it." Muslim governors used to destroy cemetery
				structures not permitted by the law, in accordance with
				the authentic sunnah. Ash-Shafi'i said: "I prefer that
				the soil used for a grave be no more than that dug for
				that grave. I like to see a grave raised above the ground
				the length of a hand or so. I prefer not to erect a
				structure over a grave or to whitewash it, for indeed
				this resembles decoration and vanity, and death is not
				the time for either of these things. I have never seen
				the graves of the Muhajirin or Ansar plastered. I have
				seen the Muslim authorities destroying structures in
				graveyards, and I have not seen any jurists object to
				this."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shawkani said: "It is apparent that raising graves
				more than what is legally permitted is forbidden. The
				followers of Ahmad, a group of the followers of
				Ash-Shafi'i, and Malik are of this opinion. An opinion
				that raised graves are not prohibited because this
				practice occurred during the time of the first and later
				generations without disapproval, which is the position of
				Imam Yahya and Mahdi in al-Ghayth, is not correct. This
				argument is based only on their silence about the
				practice, and silence is not proof when a matter rests on
				mere assumption, for prohibition of raising graves is
				presumptive."
			</p>
			<p>
				Included in the discussion of raising the grave are dome
				buildings, shrines built on graves, and erecting mosques
				around graves.The Prophet, peace be upon him, cursed
				those who did that. The practice of erecting buildings
				around graves and beautifying them causes corruption,
				which Islam seeks to eliminate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Part of such a corruption is exaggerating the importance
				of graves, in accordance with the superstitious belief of
				the ignorant, similar to the belief of non-believers in
				their idols, that these monuments can bring benefit or
				prevent harm. Thus they travel to these graves for
				fulfillment of their needs or achievement of their goals.
				They ask those in the graves what believers should ask
				only of their Lord. They ride horses to them, touch them,
				and seek their aid. In general, they do exactly what the
				pre-Islamic people used to do with their idols.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite this disgraceful, reprehensible evil and hideous
				disbelief, how many people dare to take a stand for the
				cause of Allah, or evince any uneasiness for the defense
				of the true din? Where are the scholars and students, and
				the rulers, the ministers, and the kings, who are obliged
				to teach the truth? Various reports reaching us leave
				little doubt that many of these grave adorers, in fact
				most of them, when confronted and asked under oath to
				reject such idolatry would readily take a solemn oath
				falsely by Allah. But if you then ask them, "(Swear) by
				your spiritual leader and your saint, so-and-so," they
				will ponder, apologize, refuse, and confess the truth.
				This is one of the clearest proofs that their polytheism
				is indeed worse than that of the Christians and others
				who say: "Allah, the Exalted, is the second of two or the
				third of three."
			</p>
			<p>
				O scholars of Islam! O kings of Islam! What calamity to
				Islam is worse than disbelief? What tribulation for this
				religion is worse than worshipping others than Allah?
				What misfortune for Muslims can equal this misfortune? Is
				there any more serious abomination than this open
				polytheism?

				You might be heard if you called the living, But there is

				The scholars have issued clear legal verdicts concerning
				the destruction of mosques and domes built in cemeteries.
				Ibn Hajar said in his az-Zawajir: (This is a collection
				of legal verdicts, pubhshed when king Al-Zahir decided to
				destroy all the buildings in the graveyards. Coeval
				Islamic scholars collectively supported him saying to do
				so was incumbent upon the ruler.) "We should not hesitate
				to destroy mosques and domes built over graves. These are
				worse than the mosque of adDirar, because these things
				are erected in disobedience to the Messenger of Allah,
				peace be upon him. The Prophet, peace be upon him, has
				forbidden this and has ordered the destruction of raised
				graves. Every lamp or lantern placed over a grave must be
				removed. It is not correct to stop at a grave or make a
				vow at it.

			<p>
				Ahmad disliked, however, wearing dyed shoes (Sibtiyah

				If it were permissible, the Prophet, peace be upon him,

				'Aishah said: "The only reason the grave of Allah's

				them, touching them, and offering prayers at their
				graves. (The commentator on this said: "It points to what

				saw me leaning on a grave, so he said: 'Do not harm the
				dweller in this grave or do not harm him.''' (Reported by

				through your clothes to your skin than to sit on a

				amounts to an outright prohibition because of the warning
				contained in it. He said this is the opinion of a group
				of the early Muslims of whom Abu Hurairah is one.
			</p>
			<p>
				The majority of scholars hold that such an act is merely
				disapproved. An-Nawawi said: "Ash-Shafi'i (See
				Al-Shafi'i's work Al-Umm) and the companions mentioned in

				holding it to be makruh tahrimi, (Makruh is divided into

			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar, Abu Hanifah, and Malik are of the opinion that

			</p>

				The majority of scholars interpret this prohibition as an

				that a grave is not made to last forever, but is sure to
				disintegrate with the passage of time. whitewashing
				graves is decorating them with the beauty of this world
				for which the dead have no need. Others think that its

				The scholars also disapprove of building graves with
				bricks or wood or burying the dead with a coffin unless
				the burial ground was wet or soft. If it is wet or soft,
				then it is permissible to use bricks and the like and to
				place the body in a coffin. It is reported from Mughirah
				that Ibrahim said: "The scholars preferred bricks of clay
				and straw, but disliked clay bricks; they preferred
				bamboo and disliked wood."
			</p>
			<p>
				Concerning the hadith prohibiting writing on graves, it
				apparently includes writing the name of the deceased or
				any other thing on the grave. AlHakim commented on this
				hadith and said: "Though its chain of narrators is sound,
				in practice, however, it was not followed." Many Muslims
				from the East and the West do write on the graves. This
				is a practice that was passed on from one generation to
				the next. Adh-Dhahabi said: "This hadith is an innovated
				one, and no prohibition is genuinely reported."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanbali school holds that inscription on graves is
				prohibited, whether it is a portion of the Qur'an or the
				name of the deceased." The Shafi'i school agrees with
				this ruling, but they also hold: "If the grave is of a
				scholar or a righteous man, it is preferable to write his
				name on it to make it known."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Maliki school holds that writing any portion of the
				Qur'an is not permissible, but writing the name and date
				of death of the deceased is disliked (makruh) .
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafi school disapproves of writing anything on the
				grave and considers it unlawful, except when it is feared
				that any trace of the grave might disappear. Ibn Hazm
				said: "It is not disapproved if the name of the deceased
				was engraved on a rock."
			</p>
			<p>
				It is forbidden in a hadith "to add more soil than what
				was taken out when digging the grave." Al-Baihaqi has
				dealt with this under a separate chapter entitled, "No
				adding of soil to the grave in excess of what is taken
				therefrom."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shawkani said that: "Adding apparently here means
				adding more soil than what was taken out while digging
				the grave." Some interpreted the addition to a grave as
				making a grave over another one. Ash-Shafi'i preferred,
				however, the first interpretation, saying that it was
				preferable not to add more soil than what was taken out
				while digging the grave which is preferred lest the grave
				be raised high. So long as the additional soil does not
				raise the grave higher than the ground, there is nothing
				wrong with it.

		<section heading="Burying More than One Body in One Grave">
			<p>
				From the example of early generations, we learn that one
				body is to be buried in a grave. It is disliked if more
				than one body is buried in a grave, unless there is a
				large number of corpses, and there is a scarcity of
				graves, and it is impossible to bury them separately. In
				such a case, it is permissible to bury more than one body
				in a grave. This is based on a hadith reported by Ahmad
				and Tirmidhi, who said, "The Ansar came to the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, on the day of the Battle of Uhud,
				saying: 'O Allah's Messenger! We are afflicted with
				physical injury and we are tired, what do you command us
				to do?' The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'Dig it,
				enlarge it, and deepen it, then place two or three men in
				one grave.' They asked: 'Whom should we put in first?' He
				said: 'The one who knows the most Qur'an'." Tirmidhi
				stated that it is a sound hadith. 'Abd-ur Razzaq reported
				from Wathilah ibn al-Asqa' with a sound chain of
				narrators that, "a man and a woman were buried together
				in the same grave. The man would be placed first, and
				then the woman behind him."

				The author of al-Mughni said: "If a person died while in
				a ship on the sea, then, according to Ahmad, they should
				wait a day or two to find a place to bury him, unless
				they are afraid that the corpse would decay. If they
				cannot find a place (on land) to bury him, then the
				deceased should be washed, shrouded, a funeral prayer
				offered for him, then tied with a heavy weight, it be
				thrown into the water." This is the opinion of 'Ata and
				Al-Hasan. Al-Hasan said, "He is to be put in a basket and
				then thrown into the sea." Ash-Shafi'i said: "The body
				should be placed on two boards and let into the sea so
				that the boards might take it ashore, where some people
				might find it and bury it. But if one throws it into the
				sea, one would not be committing any sin."
			</p>
			<p>
				The latter, i.e. burial at sea, is preferable, because it
				serves the purpose of covering the body which is
				comparable to burying him. Tying it between two boards is
				apt to expose it and cause it to be disfigured and
				mutilated. It might be thrown on the shore, mutilated and
				naked, or it might fall into the hands of pagans. That is
				why we believe the second course mentioned above is to be
				preferred.

		<section heading="Placing Branches of Palm on a Grave">
			<p>
				It is not lawful to put a branch of a palm or flowers on
				a grave. The contrary is suggested by the following
				hadith reported by Bukhari and others from Ibn 'Abbas:
				"The Prophet, peace be upon him, passed by two graves and
				said, 'Those two are being punished for a minor matter.
				The first did not clean himself carefully after
				urinating. The second one used to spread lies.' Then the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, asked for a fresh branch of a
				palm tree, broke it into two parts, and then placed a
				part on each of them, saying, 'I hope that this will
				reduce their punishment for as long as the branch remains
				fresh.' Al-Khattabi is of the opinion, however, that
				"This placing of a branch of a palm on the graves, while
				saying, "I hope that this will reduce their punishment
				for as long as it remains fresh," is a blessed effect of
				the Prophet, peace be upon him, and of his supplication
				to Allah to lighten their punishment."According to
				Al-Khattabi, "He hoped, as it were, that the two would be
				relieved of their punishment so long as the palm branch
				remained fresh. This, however, does not have anything to
				do with the freshness or dryness of the palm branch or
				its role in lightening the punishment as such. Though the
				masses in many of the Muslim countries place branches of
				palm over the graves of their relatives, this practice
				has no basis or merit in the light of Islamic teachings."
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Khattabi's opinion as reported above is correct. The
				Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with
				them, were familiar with this and practiced it. Bukhari
				reported that, "There is no evidence to show that anyone
				of them ever put a branch of a palm or a bunch of flowers
				on graves, except on the grave of Buraidah al-Asalmi, who
				had instructed his heirs in his will that two branches of
				palm be placed on his grave.'' (Bukhari) The idea that
				such a practice was lawful, and yet was unknown to all
				the Companions, except Buraidah, is not plausible.
				Al-Hafiz said in Al-Fath: "Apparently Buraidah took the
				hadith in its general import and did not regard it as
				specifically related to those two men." Ibn Rashid said:
				"It is apparent from Bukhari's commentary that it was
				specifically done by the Prophet, peace be upon him, for
				those two men. He also quoted a statement of Tbn 'Umar,
				who, when he noticed a tent was set up over 'Abd ur
				Rahman's grave, said: 'Take it away; the only thing that
				can shade him is his deeds'." Ibn Umar's statement shows
				that he realized that placing anything over a grave does
				not benefit the deceased, except his own good deeds.

				dwellings of the hereafter, and is more suitable a place

			</p>
			<p>
				Some people may ask: "Why then were the Prophet, peace be

				answer to this we would refer to the statement of 'Aishah
				in which she said: "This was done lest the grave of the
				Prophet be turned into a mosque.''  (Bukhari) The
				Prophet, peace be upon him, buried his Companions in the
				cemetery of "al-Baqi' in Madinah and surely his action is
				more preferable than someone else's action. The
				Companions of the Prophet regarded his burial
				arrangements as a special case for him because, as
				reported in a tradition "the Prophets are buried at the

		<section heading="The Prohibition Against Talking Ill of the Dead">
			<p>
				It is not permissible to talk ill of the deceased Muslims
				or to mention their evil deeds. This is based on
				Bukhari's report from 'Aishah that the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said: "Do not speak ill of the dead; they have
				seen the result of (the deeds) that they forwarded before
				them." Abu Daw'ud and Tirmidhi have transmitted, but with
				a weak chain of narrators, from Ibn ' Umar a similar
				hadith that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said,
				"Mention the good deeds of your dead and cover their evil
				deeds." As for those Muslims who openly do evil or
				indulge in illicit innovation, it is permissible to
				mention their evil deeds if some public good so requires
				and and as a warning to others in order to discourage
				anyone who might otherwise follow their bad example. If
				no such benefit is to be gained, then it is not
				permissible to mention anything evil about the deceased.
				Bukhari and Muslim reported that Anas said: "A funeral
				procession passed by and the people praised the deceased.
				The Prophet, peace be upon him, exclaimed, 'It is
				decided.' Then another funeral procession passed by and
				the people said some bad things about the deceased. The
				Prophet, peace be upon him, remarked, 'It is decided.'
				'Umar asked: 'What is decided?' The Prophet, peace be

			<p>
				Muslim scholars agree that a place where a Muslim is
				buried should not be disturbed if flesh, bones, or other
				parts of the body remain there. If any of his other
				remains are found it is not permissible to disturb them.
				But if the entire corpse has disintegrated into dust,
				then a new grave may be dug there. Also, in such a case
				it is permissible to use the land for planting,
				cultivation, building, and for other beneficial purposes.
				If the remains of a body, such as bones, are found during
				the digging, then the digging should be stopped. And if
				the remains are found after the digging is finished, then
				it is quite permissible to place these to one side in the
				grave and bury another body beside them.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the deceased person was buried before a funeral prayer
				was offered for him or her and the person had not yet
				been covered with soil, then the remains should be
				removed and the funeral prayer should be offered before
				reburial. But if the deceased was buried completely
				without a funeral prayer, it is unlawful, according to
				the Hanafi and the Shafi'i schools, to dig up the grave.
				This is also the opinion of Ahmad, according to one
				narration from him. In such a case, a funeral prayer
				should be offered for the deceased without disturbing the
				grave. Yet another report from Ahmad says that in such a
				case the grave should be dug up, the body exhumed, and a
				funeral prayer offered for the deceased person.
			</p>
			<p>
				The leaders of the three schools hold it permissible to
				dig up a grave for a valid reason, e.g., to remove some
				money left in the grave, to turn the face of a body
				toward the Kaibah if buried otherwise, to wash a body
				that was buried without a proper purification, and to
				improve the shroud. This is not done, however, in cases
				when it is feared that by doing so the corpse will
				disintegrate.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafi school disagrees and considers it not
				permissible to dig up a grave for any of the above
				reasons. They consider such digging of a grave as a sort
				of dismembering of the body, which is not permissible in
				any case. Ibn Qudamah countered this position by
				explaining: "It would be considered dismemberment
				(muthlah) only in the case of those whose bodies have
				rotten away. In such a case, a grave should not be dug
				up. If the deceased was buried without a shroud, then
				there are two alternatives. First, he should be left
				alone since the object of having a shroud is to cover the
				body. and that is achieved by covering it with soil.
				Second, the grave should be dug up and the body shrouded,
				because shrouding is obligatory and is as important as
				washing the body."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad said: "If the grave digger forgot and left his
				tools inside the grave, he may dig them up." The same
				applies if someone dropped an axe, some money, or
				something of value. He was asked: "What if the deceased's
				family offered the owner of the objects compensation for
				his lost valuables?"He said: "If they give him his
				rightful due, then he may not dig."
			</p>
			<p>
				Bukhari has reported a relevant hadith concerning this
				from Jabir, who said: "The Prophet, peace be upon him,
				came to Abdallah ibn Ubayy after he was lowered in his
				grave. He commanded his companions to take him out. Then
				he put him on his knees, blew his saliva over him, then
				put a shirt on him." He has also reported: "A man was
				buried with my father. I did not feel good until I
				removed him and buried him in a separate grave.''  (The
				body was taken out six months after his father's death)
			</p>
			<p>
				Bukhari has given these two hadith in a separate chapter,
				entitled: "Can a deceased be taken out of the grave for
				any reason?" Abu Daw'ud reported from Abdallah ibn ' Amr
				who said, "While we were going to al-Taif and passing by
				a grave, I heard the Prophet, peace be upon him, saying:
				'This is Abu Raghal's grave. ' He used to treat the
				Prophet insolently in the sacred precincts (of the Sacred
				Mosque). The Prophet, peace be upon him, added, 'When he
				left, a retribution overtook Abu Raghal, as it did his
				people at this place, so he was buried here. And the
				proof of this is that he was buried with a piece of gold.
				So if you dig up his grave, you will get it.' The People
				rushed to the grave, dug it up, found, and removed the
				gold piece."

			<p>
				Al-Khattabi said: "This shows that it is permissible to

		<section heading="Transfering the Body from One Place to Another">
			<p>
				The Ash-Shafi'i school considers it unlawful to transfer
				the body of a deceased from one country or town to
				another unless it is to Makkah, Madinah or Jerusalem. It
				is permissible to remove the body to one of these cities
				because of their special significance and position.If
				someone leaves instructions in his or her will that he or
				she be buried in a place other than these three cities,
				the will may not be executed, because it could delay the
				burial and cause the body to deteriorate. Likewise
				transferring the body from one grave to another is
				prohibited unless there is a valid reason for doing so,
				for example, if the deceased was buried without a proper
				wash, or was buried without tuming the deceased's face
				toward the qiblah, or the grave was damaged by flood or
				dampness.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is stated in Al-Minhaj that digging up a grave after
				burial either for removing the body or for any other
				reason is prohibited unless there is genuine reason for
				it. such as when a deceased person is buried without a
				wash or is buried in a usurped cloth or land or something
				of value is left in the grave or the deceased was buried
				without facing the qiblah.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Maliki school holds it permissible to remove the body
				from one place to another, before or after the burial,
				for a genuine reason, for example, when it is feared that
				the body of a deceased may be drowned in the sea or eaten
				up by wild animals, or when relatives want to bury the
				deceased nearby so that they may visit it more easily, or
				in order to seek the blessings of the place to which the
				body is removed. In all such cases, transferring of the
				body from one place to another is permissible provided
				its sanctity is not affected, e.g., it does not bloat,
				does not decompose or its bones do not break.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafi school considers the removal of a body from
				one place to another undesirable, and holds it preferable
				to bury a person at the place of death. The body may be
				taken for a mile or two for burial, for that is the usual
				distance to a cemetery. After the burial removing the
				body without a genuine reason is not permissible as
				mentioned above. If a woman's son dies and he is buried
				in her absence in another town, and she was impatient and
				wanted to remove his body to her own town, her request
				may not be heeded.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanbali school considers it desirable to bury a
				martyr at the place where he or she is killed. Ahmad
				said, "As to those who are slain, a hadith reported by
				Jabir from the Prophet, peace be upon him, says: 'Bury
				the martyrs wherever they are killed'." Ibn Majah
				reported: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, ordered that
				the martyrs of the Battle of Uhud be returned and buried
				at the places where they had fallen." As for the others,
				they are not to be removed from one town to another
				without a valid cause. This is the opinion of AlAwza'i
				and Ibn al-Mundhir. Abdallah ibn Malikah said: "Abd-ur
				Rahman ibn Abu Bakr died in Abyssinia and his body was
				carried to Makkah where he was buried. When 'Aishah
				visited his grave she said: 'By Allah! Had I been there
				when you died, I would not have allowed you to be buried
				anywhere except at the place where you had died. And had
				I seen you there, I would not have visited you'." Burying
				the deceased at the place of death is easier and more
				secure against deterioration of the physical remains. It
				is permissible, however, to remove the body from one
				place to another in case there is a valid reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad said: "I do not know of any harm in transferring
				the deceased from one town to another." When Az-Zuhri was
				asked about that, he said, "The bodies of Sa'd ibn Abi

				given are disbelievers, then one should say: "May Allah
				grant you a substitute." As for the response to
				condolences, the receiver should respond, "Amin" and "May
				Allah reward you."
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Ahmad, one may or may not shake hands with
				the bereaved when offering condolences. If one sees a
				person who has torn his or her clothes because of a
				misfortune, one should comfort the person, and should not
				refuse to do what is good because of his or her vain act,
				but it is good if one bids such a person to refrain from
				doing so.

			<p>
				The sunnah concerning this is that one should offer
				condolences to the bereaved family and leave. Neither the
				consoler nor the consoled should sit down. This is the
				lesson we learn from the example of our righteous
				predecessors. Ash-Shafi'i in his A1-Umm said, "I dislike
				gathering in groups together to give condolences even if
				those gathered do not cry. Such a gathering revives
				sorrow and adds to the grief and burden of the bereaved
				family. An-Nawawi said, "Ash-Shafi'i and his companions
				disliked sitting for condolences, whereby members of the
				family stay in their homes to receive anyone coming to
				give their condolences. Instead, they should go about
				their usual tasks and needs. This applies both to men and
				women. Al-Muhamili states this explicitly and transmits
				it in reference to a text from Ash-Shafi'i. This is
				makruh tanzihi (Makruh tanzihl signifies something which
				is undesirable yet is closer to the lawful) unless it is
				coupled with some other innovation. If it is accompanied
				with another forbidden innovation (bid'ah), as is
				generally the case, then it is regarded as one of the
				strongly forbidden acts. All such acts are an innovation,
				and as a sound hadith says, "All novel acts are an
				innovation and every innovation is error."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad and many other Hanafi scholars also hold this
				opinion. Early Hanafi scholars, however, held the view
				that there is nothing wrong in holding a gathering at
				places other than mosques for three days of condolence,
				so long as one does nothing prohibited. The practices of
				some people nowadays, such as gathering for condolences,
				setting up tents, spreading carpets, and incurring a lot
				of expenses out of arrogance and show off are all
				despicable innovations that are forbidden and must be
				avoided, especially when most of these acts are
				contradictory to the teachings of the Qur'an and sunnah
				and are vestiges of pre-Islamic customs of jahiliyyah.
				Some of these innovations are reciting the Qur'an in a
				melodic fashion and disregarding the rules of proper
				recitation, or not keeping silent when listening to the
				Qur' an or indulging in smoking or such other activities.
				And this is not all. Some of these slaves of their
				desires indulge in extreme innovation. They are not
				satisfied with the days originally prescribed by Islam,
				but designate Wednesday as the day to renew these
				abominations and to indulge in these innovations. They
				celebrate the anniversary of death on the first day and
				observe remembrance on the second day, and do other such
				other things without any justification by either text or
				reason.

				Visiting graves is desirable for men. 'Abdallah ibn
				Buraidah reported from his father that the Prophet, peace
				be upon him, said: "I had forbidden you to visit graves,
				but now you may visit them. It will remind you of the
				Hereafter." (Muslim, Ahmad, and the Sunan works) They
				were prohibited from visitlng the graves because of their
				proximity to the jahiliyyah (Days of Ignorance) when they
				used incorrect and obscene language. After they had fully
				entered the fold of Islam, became well pleased with it,
				and had fully accepted its laws, the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, permitted them to visit graves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported: "The Prophet, peace be upon him,
				visited his mother' s grave and cried, and everyone there
				cried with him. Then the Prophet, peace be upon him,
				said: 'I sought my Lord's permission to seek forgiveness
				for her, but He did not permit me. I then sought
				permission to visit her grave and He permitted me to do
				this. You should visit graves, because they will remind
				you of the reality of death.'' (Muslim, Ahmad, and the
				Sunan, except Tirmidhi)
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the purpose of visiting graves is admonition and
				remembrance of death, it is permissible to visit the
				graves of disbelievers. Weeping when passing by the
				graves of the wrongdoers who were seized and punished by
				Allah for their evil deeds, and to express one's humility
				and one's need for forgiveness of Allah is desirable.This
				is obvious from a hadith, reported by Bukhari on the
				authority of Ibn 'Umar, that the Prophet, peace be upon
				him, said to his Companions, when they passed through
				Al-Hijr, the dwellings of the people of Thamud, "Do not
				go without weeping to the places of burial of those who
				are undergoing torment. But if you cannot weep, then do
				not enter these places lest what befell them should
				befall you."

		<section heading="Etiquette of Visiting Graves">
			<p>
				Whoever pays a visit to a grave should face the deceased,
				greet him, and supplicate for him. On this subject we
				find the following: Buraidah reported: "The Prophet,
				peace be upon him, taught us that when we visited graves
				we should say, 'Peace be upon you, O believing men and
				women, O dwellers of this place. Certainly, Allah
				willing, we will join you. You have preceded us and we
				are to follow you.We supplicate to Allah to grant us and
				you security'.'' (Reported by Muslim, Ahmad, and others)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas reported: "Once the Prophet, peace be upon
				him, passed by graves in Madinah. He tumed his face
				toward them saying: 'Peace be upon you, O dwellers of
				these graves. May Allah forgive us and you. You have
				preceded us, and we are following your trail'."
				(Tirmidhi)
			</p>
			<p>
				'Aishah said: "Every time it was my turn to be with the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, toward the end of the night,
				he would go out to the cemetery of al-Baqi' and would
				say,
			</p>
			<p>
				'Peace be upon you, O abode of believers. What you were
				promised will come to pass tomorrow at a fixed time. We
				shall, Allah willing, soon join you. O Allah! Grant
				forgiveness to the people who are buried in al-Baqi'
				al-Gharqad',' (Muslim)
			</p>
			<p>
				'Aishah also reported: "I asked: 'What should I say when
				I pass by a graveyard, O Messenger of Allah?' He replied,
				'Say, "Peace be upon the believing men and women dwelling
				here. May Allah grant mercy to those who have preceded us
				and those who are to follow them. Certainly, Allah
				willing, we will join you"'."
			</p>
			<p>
				What some people do, like wiping hands over the graves
				and tombs, kissing them, and circumambulating around them
				are abominable innovations. Such things should not be
				done, for they are unlawful. These things are
				permissible, however, if performed in relation with the
				House of Allah, the Ka'abah, for Allah has so honored it.
				The grave of the Prophet, peace be upon him, cannot be
				considered a similar case, nor the tomb of a saint. All
				good comes from adherence to his example whereas all evil
				flows from innovating new things in religion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim said: "The Prophet, peace be upon him,
				visited the graves to supplicate for their inhabitants,
				and to seek mercy and forgiveness of Allah for them.
				Contrary to this, the pagans supplicated to the dead,
				swearing by them, asking them for their needs, and
				seeking their support and help. Such pagan practices are
				in conflict with the guidance of the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, and his teachings about the Oneness of Allah
				and about the manner of supplicating for Allah's mercy
				for the dead. The people who do such things are guilty of
				polytheism; they are indulging in sin, and bringing evil
				to the deceased.They may be divided into three
				categories: those who supplicate for the deceased, those
				who supplicate through the deceased, and the third who
				supplicate to the deceased. They think that making
				supplications by a grave is better than in a mosque. For
				anyone who looks to the guidance of the Messenger of
				Allah, peace be upon him, and his Companions, the
				distinction between the two cited positions is fairly
				obvious."

		<section heading="Can Women Visit Graves">
			<p>
				Imam Malik and some Hanafi scholars, and, according to
				one report from Ahmad, most of the scholars hold it
				permissible for women to visit graves. This is based on
				the following hadith from 'Aishah, "What should I say to
				them, O Messenger of Allah when visiting graves?" As
				mentioned above Abdallah ibn Abi Mulaikah is also
				reported to have said, "Once 'Aishah returned after
				visiting the graveyard. I asked, 'O Mother of the
				Believers, where have you been?' She said: 'I went out to
				visit the grave of my brother Abd ar-Rahman.' I asked
				her: 'Didn't the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,
				prohibit visiting graves?' She said, 'Yes, he did forbid
				visiting graves during the early days, but later on he
				ordered us to visit them'." This is reported by Al-Hakim
				and Al-Baihaqi, who also remarked that this hadith was
				narrated only by Bistam bin Muslim al-Basri. Adh-Dhahabi
				said that it is a sound hadith.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anas reported: "The Prophet, peace be upon him, saw a
				woman crying by the grave of her son, and said to her,
				'Fear Allah, and be patient.' She replied, 'What do you
				care about my tragedy?' When he went away, someone told
				her, 'Indeed, that was the Messenger of Allah, peace be
				upon him. ' The woman felt extremely sorry and she
				immediately went to the Prophet's house, where she did
				not find any guards. She called out: 'O Messenger of
				Allah! I did not recognize you.' The Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said, 'Verily patience is needed at the time of
				the first affiction'.'' (Bukhari and Muslim) This
				supports the argument in favor of the permissibility of
				women visiting graves, for the Prophet, peace be upon
				him, saw her at the grave and did not show his
				disapproval of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The purpose of visiting graves is to remember the
				Hereafter, which is something that both men and women
				need. Men are by no means more in need of this reminder
				than women. Some scholars disliked it for women to visit
				graves as they are less patient and too emotional. The
				Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "May Allah curse the
				women who are frequent visitors of the graves." (Reported
				by Ahmad, Ibn Majah, and Tirmidhi, who said that it is a
				sound hadith)
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Qurtubi said: "The curse mentioned in this hadith
				applies only to those women who visit graves frequently.
				The reason for this curse lies perhaps in the fact that
				it involves infringement of the rights of the husband,
				and leads to adornment and exhibition of their beauty to
				strangers, and shouting, yelling, and other similar
				things." It may be said that, "If no such harm is feared
				from women visiting graves, then there is no valid reason
				for preventing them from visiting graves, for indeed
				remembrance of death is something that both men and women
				equally need." Commenting on Al-Qurtubi's view,
				Ash-Shawkani said, "This statement may form the basis for
				reconciling apparently contradictory hadith."

		<section heading="The Deeds that Benefit the Departed Souls and Proffering Reward for Good Deeds to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)">
			<p>
				There is consensus that a deceased person benefits from
				all good deeds for which he or she in his or her life
				might have been a cause. Abu Hurairah reported, "The
				Prophet, peace be upon him, said, 'When a person dies all
				his good deeds cease except for three: a continuous act
				of charity, beneficial knowledge, and a righteous son who
				prays for him'.'' (Muslim, and the Sunan) Also Abu
				Hurairah reported, "The Prophet, peace be upon him, said,
				'The righteous works that continue to benefit a believer
				after his death include the knowledge that he taught and
				spread among others, a righteous son whom he leaves
				behind, or a copy of the Qur'an that he bequeaths to his
				inheritors, or a mosque that he builds, or a rest house
				that he builds for the wayfarers, or a canal of water
				that he digs for the benefit of others, or a charity that
				he gives out of his property during his life while he is
				sound of health. He will continue to receive reward for
				all these even after his death.' (Ibn Majah)
			</p>
			<p>
				Jarir ibn Abdallah reported: "The Prophet, peace be upon
				him, said: 'Whoever introduces a good practice in Islam
				will get its reward and the rewards for all those who
				follow these practices after him, without any loss to
				their reward. And whoever introduces a bad practice in
				Islam will acquire its sin and the sins of all those who
				practice it, without any decrease in their sins."
			</p>
			<p>
				An account of the righteous deeds performed by others
				that continue to be beneficial to the deceased is given
				in detail below:
			</p>
			<p>
				l) Asking Allah for His forgiveness. The scholars agree
				that it is good to do this, because Allah says in the
				Qur'an: "Those who came after them say, 'O Allah! Forgive
				us and our brothers who preceded us in faith. Do not put
				animosity in our hearts for those who believe. Our Lord,
				indeed, You are Most Merciful, Most Kind." Qur'an 59.10 A
				saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him, reads, "When
				you offer the funeral prayer for the deceased, make
				supplications for this person." This has already been
				mentioned above. The Prophet, peace be upon him, taught
				us the supplication: "O Allah! Forgive our living and our
				dead." Generations of Muslims, both past and present,
				have been supplicating to Allah for His mercy and
				forgiveness for their dead. Such a practice has continued
				without any dissent or disagreement among scholars.
			</p>
			<p>
				An-Nawawi said, "The most well-known position of the
				Shafi'i school is that this does not benefit the
				deceased." Ahmad ibn Hanbal and a group of Shafi' i
				scholars hold that it does benefit the deceased . The
				reciter has an option. He may supplicate for the deceased
				to be rewarded for the recitation, saying: "O Allah!
				Grant the reward of what I recited to so-and-so."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Qudamah in al-Mughni stated, "Ahmad ibn Hanbal said,
				'The deceased will receive the reward for every good done
				on his behalf. This is proved by textual evidence found
				on this subject. The fact that Muslims in every city
				gather to recite the Qur'an for the benefit of the
				deceased and that they have been doing so without any
				disagreement or disapproval show that there is consensus
				on this subject'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Those who hold that the deceased benefits by the
				recitation of others make it conditional upon the reciter
				not to accept any payment for his recitation. If the
				reciter is paid for reciting, it is unlawful for both the
				giver and the receiver, and he shall have no reward for
				his reciting. Abd Ar Rahman ibn Shibl reported that the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Recite the Qur'an, and
				do good deeds .... Do not neglect it, nor be extreme in
				it. Do not make it a means of living nor a source of your
				wealth.'' (Reported by Ahmad, At-Tabarani, and
				Al-Baihaqi)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim said, "Worship is of two types: financial
				and physical. The Prophet, peace be upon him, has
				informed us that because charity (sadaqah) benefits the
				deceased, all other acts of charity will also benefit the
				deceased, and that because fasting on his behalf benefits
				the deceased, all other physical acts of worship will
				likewise benefit the deceased. Similarly the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, informed us that the reward of making
				Hajj, which involves both physical and financial
				sacrifice, does indeed benefit the deceased. Thus these
				three types of beneficial acts of worship are supported
				by both the revealed texts and reason."

				The performer must have the intention of performing an

				a gift to a deceased Muslim, the deceased will receive
				the reward for it, provided that he has a prior intention

				Ibn al-Qayyim said, "The best present for the deceased is
				an act that is most beneficial to people, for example,
				freeing a slave.Thus a sadaqah giving in charity is
				better than fasting on behalf of the deceased. The best
				charity is that which fulfills someone's need and is
				continuous. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "The
				best charity is to give people a drink of water." This
				applies to a place where water is scarce. Otherwise,
				giving someone a drink of water from a river or a canal
				would not be better than feeding the hungry who need
				food. Likewise, supplication and asking forgiveness for
				the deceased is beneficial to the deceased, especially
				when the supplicant is sincere, earnest, and humble in
				his supplication. Such a supplication is better than
				charity, just as regular prayer (salah) is better than
				the funeral prayer and than supplicating for the deceased
				by his grave.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, the best gift to send the deceased is freeing

				The children of Muslims who die prior to the age of
				puberty go to Paradise. 'Adi ibn Thabit reported that he
				heard al-Bara' saying, "When Ibrahim, son of the Prophet
				died, the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, 'Verily, he
				will have suckling in Paradise'.''  (Bukhari) Al-Hafiz
				said in Al-Fath, "Bukhari indicates his view on this
				subject when he makes the statement that 'they are in
				Paradise'." Anas ibn Malik reported that the Prophet,

				children and they die prior to reaching the age of
				puberty, Allah will cause him to enter Paradise on
				account of His mercy to them."
			</p>
			<p>
				It is clear from this hadith that those children who
				become a reason for others to enter Paradise, would
				themselves be in a far better position to enter it,

			<p>
				As for children of non-Muslims, they are similar to the

		<section heading="The Questioning in the Grave">
			<p>
				Allahl al-Sunnah wa Al-Jama'ah agree that each person
				will be questioned after his death, whether he is buried
				or not. Even if a person were eaten by carnivorous
				animals or bumt to ashes and thrown into the air or
				drowned in the sea, he or she would be questioned about
				his or her deeds, and rewarded with good or evil
				depending on his or her deeds in life. Both the body and
				the soul together experience punishment or reward.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim said, "The early Muslim community and its
				prominent scholars held that after death, a person is
				either in bliss or torment both physically and
				spiritually. After its separation from the body, the soul
				endures a state of happiness or punishment. At times,
				when the soul rejoins the body, both of them receive
				torture or joy. On the Day of Resurrection, the souls
				will be returned to the bodies and they will rise from
				their graves and stand before the Lord of the worlds. The
				Muslims, Christians, and Jews, all believe in the
				resurrection of the body.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Maruzi related that Imam Ahmad said, "The punishment
				in the grave is a reality, and only he who is misguided
				or wants to misguide others denies it."
			</p>
			<p>
				Hanbal said, "I asked Abu Abdallah about the punishment
				in the grave. He said, 'These are the sound hadith and we
				believe in them and affirm them. We affirm everything
				that comes from the Prophet, peace be upon him, with a
				sound chain of narrators. If we were to confirm a report
				as being from the Prophet, peace be upon him, and then
				reject it or oppose it, we would be denying the Word of
				Allah, "Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it".'  I
				asked him, 'Is the punishment of the grave a reality?' He
				said, 'Yes, it is a reality. The people are punished in
				their graves. ' I heard Abu Abdallah saying, 'We believe
				in the punishment of the grave, in Munkar and Nakir (the
				two questioning angels), and that the deceased will be
				questioned in their graves.' The Qur'an states that
				'Allah will establish in strength those who believe in
				the Word, that stands firm in this world and in the
				Hereafter,'  Qur'an 14.27 that is, in the grave."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad ibn al-Qasim said, I asked, 'O Abu Abdallah! Do you
				believe in Munkar andNakir and what is related conceming
				the punishment of the grave? ' He said, 'Glory to
				Allah.Yes, we do confirm that and we declare so.'I said,
				'This expression that you use, is it Munkar and Nakir? Or
				do you call them, "The two angels?"' He answered: 'Munkar
				and Nakir.'I said, 'They say, "There is no mention of
				Munkar and Nakir in the hadith".' He replied, 'Of course
				there is. There is Munkar and Nakir'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Hafiz said in Al-Fath, "Ahmad ibn Hazm and Ibn
				Hubairah are of the opinion that the questioning is
				addressed to the soul only, without its returning to the
				body. The majority of Muslim scholars, however, disagree
				with them. They say, 'The soul is returned to the body or
				some of it, as is confirmed by the hadith. Had the
				punishment been directed at the soul only, there would
				not be concern for the body. The scattered parts of a
				body should pose no problem, for Allah is able to give
				life to any part of a body, and then address the
				questioning to that particular part. Likewise, He is able
				to gather all its parts easily'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Those who hold that the questioning will be addressed
				only to the soul say that if one were to examine the body
				in the grave at the time of the questioning, one will
				notice no trace of its sitting or any other movement.One
				will also notice that the grave is neither more narrow
				nor spacious. Similar is the case of those who are not
				buried in any grave, e.g., the people who are crucified.
				To counter this objection, it is maintained that it is
				not impossible. Rather, in physical life we find a
				similar example, namely, sleeping. A sleeping person
				experiences both pleasure and pain, but his companion
				cannot notice any of its effects on him. In fact, even a
				person who is wide awake also feels pain and pleasure
				when he hears or thinks of his painful or pleasant
				experiences, but its effects cannot be noticed.
				Considering the unseen in the light of what is seen or
				guessing about life after death in terms of the present
				life is the mistake of this fallacious thinking.
			</p>
			<p>
				Obviously Allah has screened the sights and sounds of the
				other world from man, and with our limited physical
				faculties, we are incapable of perceiving the vast
				kingdom of heavens, unless Allah wills it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The opinion of the majority in this respect is supported
				by various hadith. The Prophet, peace be upon him, for
				example, told us, "the deceased hears the sound of their
				footsteps"; "his ribs are altered because of the embrace
				of the grave"; "the sound of his voice resounds when the
				angel strikes him with a hammer"; "he is struck between
				his ears," or "they (the two angels) will cause him to
				sit up." All these hadith refer to various bodily
				conditions. We will mention here some of the sound hadith
				concerning this subject.
			</p>
			<p>
				Zaid ibn Thabit reported, "The Prophet, peace be upon
				him, was going with us toward the dwellings of Banu
				an-Najjar. He was riding a pony, which spooked and he
				nearly fell off. He found four, five, or six graves
				there, and asked, 'Which of you knows about those lying
				in these graves?' Someone said, ' I do . ' Thereupon the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, asked, ' In what state did
				they die? ' He replied, 'They died as polytheists. ' He
				said, "These people are passing through an ordeal in the
				graves. You would stop burying your dead in the graves if
				you heard the torment in the grave that I hear. If it
				were not for this fact, I should have certainly made you
				listen to it.' Then turning his face toward us, he
				admonished, 'Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of

				with Allah from the torment of the grave. ' He warned,
				'Seek refuge with Allah from temptations both visible and
				invisible.' They replied, 'We seek refuge with Allah from
				temptation (fitnah) in every visible and invisible form.'
				Then he added, 'Seek refuge with Allah from the
				temptation of the Dajjal.' They said, 'We seek refuge
				with Allah from the temptation of the Dajjal'.''

				Qatadah reported that Anas ibn Malik said, "The Prophet,
				peace be upon him, said, 'When a human is laid in his
				grave and his companions return and he hears their
				footsteps, two angels will come to him and make him sit
				and ask him, "What did you say about this man, Muhammad,
				may peace be upon him?" He will say, "I testify that he
				is Allah's servant and His Messenger." Then it will be
				said to him, "Look at your place in Hell-Fire. Allah has
				exchanged for you a place in Paradise instead of it".'
				The Prophet, peace be upon him, added, 'The dead person
				will see both his places. As for a non-believer or a
				hypocrite, he will respond to the angels, "I do not know,
				but I used to say what the people used to say ! " It will
				be said to him, "Neither did you know nor did you seek
				guidance from those who had knowledge." Then he will be
				hit with an iron hammer between his two ears, and he will
				cry and that cry will be heard by all except human beings
				and jinns'." (Bukhari and Muslim)

				Al-Bara ibn 'Azib reported: The Prophet, peace be upon
				him, said, 'When a Muslim is questioned in his grave, he
				bears witness that there is no god but Allah, and that
				Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.' According to one
				report, the verse, 'Allah will establish in strength
				those who believe with the Word, that stands firm in this
				world and in the Hereafter' (Qur'an 14.27) was revealed
				concerning the punishment of the grave. The deceased will
				be asked, 'Who is your Lord?' He will say, 'Allah is my
				Lord and Muhammad is my Prophet.' That is what is meant
				by the statement of Allah, 'Allah will make firm those
				who believe with a firm statement in this life and in the
				hereafter'." (Al-Bukhari, Muslim, and Sunan)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad and Abu Hatim reported that the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said, "When a deceased person is laid in his
				grave, he hears the sound of the footsteps of people as
				they go away. If he is a believer, the prayer will stand
				by his head, the fasting will be to his right, alms to
				his left, and all other good deeds of charity, kindness
				to relations, and good behavior will be by his feet. The
				deceased will be questioned by the angels at his head.
				The prayer will say, 'There is no entrance through me.'
				Then he will be questioned by his right side where
				fasting will say, 'There is no entrance through me.' Then
				he will be questioned by his left side where charity will
				say, 'There is no entrance through me.' Then he will be
				questioned by his feet where the good acts of voluntary
				charity, kindness to relations, and good behavior will
				say, 'There is no entrance through me.' Then they will
				say to him, 'Get up.'And he will get up. The sun will
				appear to him and it will begin to set. Then they will
				ask, 'This man who was among you, what do you say about
				him? What is your testimony about him?' The man will say,
				'Let me pray.' The angels will say, 'You will pray.
				Answer our question. What do you think about this man who
				was among you? What do you say concerning him? What do
				you testify concerning him?' The deceased will say, I
				bear witness that Muhammad was the Messenger of Allah who
				brought the truth from Allah.' The deceased will be told,
				'According to this you lived, died, and according to this
				you will be resurrected, if Allah wills.'
			</p>
			<p>
				"Then a door to Paradise will be opened for him. He will
				be told, 'This is your place in Paradise and what Allah
				has prepared for you. ' At this the desire and happiness
				of the deceased will increase. His grave will be enlarged
				70 arms-length and his grave will be lit up. His body
				will change to his original form and his spirit will be
				placed in a bird dangling by the trees of Paradise in a
				nice breeze." The Prophet, peace be upon him, added,
				"That is what is meant by the statement of Allah, 'Allah
				will establish in strength those who believe with the
				Word that stands firm, in this world and in the
				Hereafter'." He also mentioned the unbeliever and said,
				"His grave will be compressed, so that his ribs will be
				crushed together. About this the Qur'an says, 'Verily,
				for him is a narrow life and We will resurrect him blind
				on the Day of Resurrection'.'' Qur'an 20.124

				Samura ibn Jundub reported, "The Prophet, peace be upon
				him, after the prayers would turn toward us and ask us,
				'Did any one of you have a dream?' If someone had, he
				would relate it. Upon hearing it the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, would say, 'Whatsoever Allah wills (is done).'
				One day he questioned us saying, 'Did anyone of you have
				a dream?' They answered, 'No.' Then the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said, 'But I saw tonight two men. They came to
				me. They held my hand and took me to the holy land. We
				came across a man Iying down, and behold, another man was
				standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he
				was throwing the rock at the man's head, crushing it. The
				rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and brought
				it back. By the time he reached the man, his head was
				restored to its normal state. The thrower then did the
				same as he had done before. I asked my two companions,
				"Who are these two people?" They said, "Proceed!" So we
				proceeded and came to a man lying flat on his back and
				another man standing over his head with an iron hook.
				Behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's
				mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back of
				the neck and similarly tear his nose from front to back
				and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the
				other side of the man's face and did just as he had done
				with the other side. As soon as he tore one side, the
				other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned
				to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two
				companions, "Who are these two people?" They said to me,
				"Proceed!" So we proceeded and saw a hole like an oven,
				narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, and fire
				burning in it. In that oven there were naked men and
				women, and behold, flames of fire were reaching them from
				underneath, and when it reached them, they would be
				raised high until they were close to the mouth of the
				oven. Then the fire subsided and they went back inside it
				again. I asked, "Who are these?" They said to me,
				"Proceed!" And so we proceeded and came to a river of
				blood. And behold, in the middle of the river was a man
				standing, and on the bank there was one who had many
				stones. The man who was in the river would try to leave
				but the other man would throw rocks into his mouth so
				that he would return to where he was. Every time the
				former tried to leave, the other would throw rocks into
				his mouth. Then he would return to where he was. I asked,
				"Who are these people?" They replied, "Proceed! Proceed!"
				We proceeded until we came to a man with a repulsive
				appearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw in
				a man! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it
				and running around it. I asked my companions, "Who is
				this (man)?" They said to me, "Proceed! Proceed!" So we
				proceeded until we reached a garden of deep green dense
				vegetation, bedecked with all sorts of spring colors. In
				the middle of the garden there was a very tall man. I
				could hardly see his head because of his great height.
				And around him there were more children than I had ever
				seen before. I said to my companions, "Who is this?" They
				replied, "Proceed! Proceed!" So we proceeded until we
				came to a huge majestic garden, greater and better than I
				have ever seen! My two companions said to me, "Go up,"
				and I went up.'
			</p>
			<p>
				"The Prophet, peace be upon him, added, 'So we ascended
				until we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks.
				We went to its gate and asked the gatekeeper to open the
				gate. It was opened and we entered the city. There we
				found men with one side of their bodies as handsome as
				the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the
				other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever
				seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw
				themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river
				flowing through the city, and its water was as white as
				milk. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then
				returned to us after the ugliness of their bodies had
				disappeared and they turned in the best shape.' I said to
				them, "I have seen many wonders tonight. What is the
				meaning of all that I have seen?"
			</p>
			<p>
				They replied, "We will inform you. As for the first man
				you came upon whose head was being crushed with the rock,
				he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur'an and
				then neither recites it nor acts on it, and sleeps,
				neglects the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came
				upon whose mouth, nostrils, and eyes were torn off from
				front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out
				of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that
				it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and
				women whom you saw in the oven, they are the adulterers
				and the adulteresses, and the man whom you saw in the
				river of blood is the usurer. As for the man by the base
				of the tree, he was Abraham. As for the children around
				him, they are the children of the people. (The narrator
				added, "Some Muslims asked the Prophet. peace be upon
				him, 'O Messenger of Allah! What about the children of
				pagans?' The Prophet, peace be upon him, replied, 'And
				also the children of pagans'.") And the man whom you saw
				near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik,
				the gatekeeper of Hell."'
			</p>
			<p>
				"The Prophet, peace be upon him, added, 'My two
				companions explained, "The men you saw half handsome and
				half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that
				was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave
				them." The first house is the common believer's house. As
				for this house, it is the house of martyrs. I am Gabriel
				and this is Michael. Now, raise your head."
			</p>
			<p>
				When I raised my head, I saw a palace that looked like a
				cloud. They said, "This is your home." I said, "Let me
				enter my house." They said, "You still have some life to
				complete on earth. Upon completing it, you may come to
				your home''.'  (Al-Bukhari)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim explained, "This is a text that pertains to
				the punishment of barzakh, for a vision by the Prophets
				is like revelation demonstrating the reality."
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Tahawi reported from Ibn Mas'ud that the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, said, "A person was ordered to be
				lashed a hundred times in his grave. He continuously
				asked Allah to decrease his punishment until only one
				lash remained. His grave was totally filled by fire. When
				the fire was removed, he regained consciousness and
				asked, 'Why was I lashed?' He was told, 'You offered a
				prayer once without proper purification, and you passed
				by an oppressed person but you did not help him'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Anas reported, "The Prophet, peace be upon him, once
				heard a voice from a grave. He asked, 'When did this one
				die?' They said, 'He died during the pre-Islamic era.' He
				was pleased to hear that and remarked, 'Had I not feared
				that you would stop burying your dead, I would have asked
				Allah to let you hear the punishment of the grave'."

				'Abdallah ibn 'Umar reported, "The Prophet, peace be upon

				funeral prayer). (His grave) was compressed and later on
				was expanded for him'.''  (Nasa'i)

		<section heading="The Abode of Souls">
			<p>
				Ibn al-Qayyim dealt with this subject under a separate
				chapter in which he mentions opinions of various scholars
				concerning the abode of souls. Mentioning the most
				correct position he explained, "It is said that the
				abodes of the souls in barzakh vary considerably. Some of
				them are in the highest reaches of the heavens, such as
				the souls of the Prophets, peace be upon them all. Their
				status also varies as observed by the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, during the night of Isra."
			</p>
			<p>
				Some souls are in the form of green birds who roam around
				freely in Paradise. These are the souls of some of the
				martyrs, but not all of them. The souls of some martyrs
				are prevented from entering Paradise on account of their
				debts or some other similar thing. This is supported by a
				report by Ibn Hanbal in his Musnad from Muhammad ibn
				Abdallah ibn Jahsh that "A man came to the Prophet, peace
				be upon him, and asked, 'O Allah's Prophet! What would I
				have if I am killed in the cause of Allah?' The Prophet,
				peace be upon him, replied, 'Paradise.'  But, when the
				man got up to go, the Prophet added, 'Unless you have
				some debts to pay. Gabriel has informed me about it just
				now'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Some souls will be locked out at the gate of Paradise, in
				accordance with this hadith: "I have seen your companion
				locked out at the gate of Paradise." Other souls are
				restricted to their graves as is evident from the hadith
				about the martyr who had stolen a cloak (He had stolen it
				out of the spoils of war before their proper
				distribution) when he was killed, the people asked, "Will
				he have bliss in Paradise?" The Prophet, peace be upon
				him, said, "By Him in whose hand is my soul, the cloak
				which he stole causes a fire to flare over him in his
				grave."
			</p>
			<p>
				The abode of others is at the gate of Paradise, as
				described in a hadith by Ibn 'Abbas that, "The abode of
				martyrs is in a green dome, on a bright river, near the
				gate of Paradise. Their provision comes from Paradise in
				the morning and in the evening.''  (Ahmad) This does not
				apply to Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, whose hands were
				transformed into wings, and with these he flies wherever
				he wishes in Paradise.
			</p>
			<p>
				Others remain confined to earth, for these souls cannot
				rise to heaven. Indeed, these are base, earthly souls
				which do not mix with the heavenly souls, just as they do
				not mix with them during their sojourn on earth. A soul
				that is oblivious to its Lord, blind to His love,
				negligent of His remembrance, and remiss in seeking His
				pleasure is a despicable earthly soul. After separation
				from its body, it cannot go anywhere, but remains here.
				On the other hand, the heavenly soul in this life clings
				to the love of Allah and to His remembrance, and seeks
				His pleasure and nearness. After separation from its
				body, it will join other kindred heavenly souls. In the
				barzakh (Literally an interval, a separation or a
				partition, Al-barzakh may be defined as the intervening
				state between death and the Last Day) and on the Day of
				Resurrection a person will be with those he loved. Allah
				will join some souls with others in the abode of barzakh
				and on the Day of Resurrection, placing the believer's
				soul with other pure souls, that is, other pure souls
				kindred to his soul. A soul, after separation from the
				body, joins other kindred souls who in their nature and
				deeds are similar to it and stays with them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some souls would be thrown in an oven or a pit along with
				other fornicators and harlots. Other souls would be in a
				river of blood, floating therein and swallowing rocks.The
				two categories of souls - the blessed and the damned - do
				not share a similar abode, for there are souls that
				reside in the highest reaches of heavens, while the
				others, low and mean earthly souls, cannot rise above the
				earth.
			</p>
			<p>
				When one ponders the hadith and traditions on this
				subject carefully, one can easily find the reason for
				this. There is no contradiction in the sound traditions
				on this subject. In fact, they are all true and each
				supports the other. It is important, however, to
				understand the soul and to appreciate its essence and the
				laws that govern its functions. Indeed, the soul is
				something completely different from the body. It is in
				Paradise, but at the same time is attached to the grave
				and the body in it. It is the swiftest thing in moving,
				relocating, ascending, or descending from one place to
				another.These souls are divided into various categories:
				the ones that are free to move about, those that are
				confined, the ones that are celestial, and the others
				that are earthly and of a low order. After separation
				from their bodies, souls do experience health and
				sickness, and they feel far more pleasure and pain than
				they experienced when they were joined together.They are
				subject to confinement, pain, punishment, sickness, and
				grief as they are to various states of joy, rest, bliss,
				and freedom. How similar is its condition in the body to
				when it was in the womb of its mother! And likewise how
				analogous is its situation after separation from the body
				to when it came out of the womb into this world! There
				are four abodes of the soul, and each abode is bigger and
				greater than the previous one.
			</p>
			<p>
				The soul's first abode is the womb of the mother, where
				there is confinement, compression, seclusion, and three
				layers of darkness.The second abode is its earthly
				habitat where it grows, does good and evil, and
				accumulates blessings for its ultimate success or
				failure. Its third abode is the abode of barzakh, which
				is more spacious and immense than the abode of this
				world. This abode, compared to the fourth one, is like
				this [third] abode compared to the first abode.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fourth abode is the abode of eternity, either
				Paradise or Hell. There is no other abode after
				these.Allah causes the soul to pass through these abodes
				in stages, until it reaches the abode most suitable for
				it, an abode that only it deserves and for which it is
				[uniquely] suitable, because this abode was created for
				it, and the soul was given the ability to perform the
				deeds that lead precisely to this abode.
			</p>
			<p>
				In each abode the soul enjoys a peculiar status and
				position altogether different from what it has in other
				abodes. Blessed indeed is soul's Originator and Creator,
				Who gives it life, causes it to die, makes it happy or
				subjects it grief and sorrow. Blessed is He Who appointed
				for it various levels of success and failure, and
				distinguished them by various grades in accordance with
				their knowledge, performance, faculties, and
				morality.Whoever truly understands and appreciates this
				cannot, but bear witness to the fact that there is no
				deity except Allah, Who has no partners. With Him alone
				rests all authority, praise, and all that is good, and to
				Him alone all affairs return for decision. His is the
				absolute authority, and all dominion, might, honor,
				wisdom, and perfection free of any defects or
				imperfections. He is known through the testimony of His
				truthful Prophets and Messengers. They did indeed come
				with Truth. Reason testifies to its truthfulness, and
				nature supports and confirms it. And anything that
				contradicts this testimony is untrue.

				All words of praise and glory to Allah, extolling His
				Perfect Attributes of Power and Majesty, Beauty and
				Sublimeness, whether one utters them by tongue or says
				them silently in one's heart, are known as dhikr or
				remembrance of Allah. He has commanded us to remember Him
				always and ever. The Qur'an says: O you who believe!
				Celebrate the praises of Allah, and do so often; and
				glorify Him morning and evening. Qur'an 33.41
			</p>
			<p>
				If anyone remembers Allah, He remembers that person:
				"Remember me, I shall remember you." Qur'an 2.152 In a
				hadith qudsi, the Prophet, peace be upon him, narrated:
				"Allah says: 'I am to my servant as he expects of Me, I
				am with him when he remembers Me. If he remembers Me in
				his heart, I remember him to Myself, and if he remembers
				me in an assembly, I mention him in an assembly better
				than his, and if he draws nearer to Me a hand's span, I
				draw nearer to him an arm's length, and if he draws
				nearer to Me an arm's length, I draw nearer to him a
				fathom length, and if he comes to me walking, I rush to
				him at [great] speed. (Bukhari and Muslim)
			</p>
			<p>
				Allah has bestowed a special distinction upon those who
				remember Him. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "The
				devotees have surpassed all." They asked, "Who are these
				exceptional people (Mufarridun), O Prophet of Allah?" He
				replied, "Those men and women who remember Allah
				unceasingly." (Muslim) These are the people who are
				really alive. Abu Musa reported, "The likeness of the one
				who remembers his Lord and the one who does not remember
				Him is like that of a living to a dead person.''
				(Bukhari)
			</p>
			<p>
				Remembrance of Allah is the foundation of good deeds.
				Whoever succeeds in it is blessed with the close
				friendship of Allah. That is why the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, used to make remembrance of Allah at all times.
				When a man complained, "The laws of Islam are too heavy
				for me, so tell me something that I can easily follow,"
				the Prophet, peace be upon him, told him, "Let your
				tongue be always busy with the remembrance of Allah." The
				Prophet, peace be upon him, would often tell his
				Companions, "Shall I tell you about the best of deeds,
				the most pure in the sight of your Lord, about the one
				that is of the highest order and is far better for you
				than spending gold and silver, even better for you than
				meeting your enemies in the battlefield where you strike
				at their necks and they at yours?" The Companions
				replied, "Yes, O Messenger of Allah!" The Prophet, peace
				be upon him, said, "Remembrance of Allah.''  (Reported by
				Tirmidhi, Ahmad, and Al-Hakim, who considers its chain of
				narrators sound)
			</p>
			<p>
				Remembrance of Allah is also a means of deliverance from
				Hell Fire. Mu'adh reported, "The Prophet, peace be upon
				him, said, 'No other act of man is a more effective means
				for his deliverance from the chastisement of Allah than
				the remembrance of Allah.''  (Ahmad) Ahmad reports that
				the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Whatever you say
				in celebration of Allah's Glory, Majesty, and Oneness,
				and all your words of Praise for Him gather around the
				Throne of Allah. These words resound like the buzzing of
				bees, and call attention to the person who uttered them
				to Allah. Don't you wish to have someone there in the
				presence of Allah who would call attention to you?"

				Allah, the Exalted, ordered that He should be remembered
				a lot. Describing the wise men and women who ponder His
				signs, the Qur'an mentions, "those who remember Allah
				standing, sitting and on their sides,''  Qur'an 3.191 and
				"those men and women who engage much in Allah's praise.
				For them has Allah prepared forgiveness and a great
				reward.''  Qur'an 33.35 Mujahid explained, "A person
				cannot be one of 'those men and women who remember Allah
				much' as mentioned in the above verse of the Qur'an,
				unless he or she remembers Allah at all times, standing,
				sitting, or lying in bed."
			</p>
			<p>
				When asked how much dhikr one should do to be considered
				as one of "those who remember Allah much," Ibn Al-Salah
				said that "much" is "when one is constant in
				supplicating, in the morning and evening and in other
				parts of the day and the night as reported from the
				Prophet, peace be upon him." Concerning the above Quranic
				verses 'Ali b. Abi Talha relates that Ibn 'Abbas said,
				"All obligations imposed upon man by Allah are clearly
				marked and one is exempted from them in the presence of a
				genuine cause. The only exception is the obligation of
				dhikr. Allah has set no specific limits for it, and under

				Sa' id b. Jubair said, "Anyone engaged in obeying Allah
				is in fact engaged in the remembrance of Allah." Some of
				the earlier scholars tied it to some more specified form.
				'Ata said, "The gatherings of dhikr are the gatherings

				marriage, divorce, and pilgrimage." Al-Qurtubi said,
				"Gatherings of dhikr are the gatherings for knowledge and
				admonition, those in which the Word of Allah and the
				sunnah of His Messenger, accounts of our righteous
				predecessors, and sayings of the righteous scholars are
				learned and practiced without any addition or innovation,
				and without any ulterior motives or greed."

		<section heading="Etiquette of Dhikr">
			<p>
				The purpose of dhikr is to purify hearts and souls and
				awaken the human conscience. The Qur'an says, "And
				establish regular prayer, for prayer restrains from
				shameful and unjust deeds, and remembrance of Allah is
				the greatest thing in life, without doubt.'' Qur'an 29.45
				In other words, the remembrance of Allah has a greater
				impact in restraining one from shameful and unjust deeds
				than just the formal regular prayer. This is so because
				when a servant opens up his soul to his Lord, extolling
				His praise, Allah strengthens him with His light,
				increasing thereby his faith and conviction, and
				reassuring his mind and heart. This refers to "those who
				believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the
				remembrance of Allah, for without doubt in the
				remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.''
				Qur'an 13.28
			</p>
			<p>
				And when hearts are satisfied with the Truth, they turn
				to the highest ideals without being deflected by impulses
				of desire or lust. This underscores the importance of
				dhikr in man's life. Obviously it would be unreasonable
				to expect these results just by uttering certain words,
				for words of the tongue unsupported by a willing heart
				are of no consequence. Allah Himself has taught us the
				manner in which a person should remember Him, saying,
				"And do bring your Lord to remembrance in your very soul,
				with humility and in reverence, without loudness in
				words, in the mornings and evening, and be not of those
				who are unheedful.'' Qur'an 7.205
			</p>
			<p>
				This verse indicates that doing dhikr in silence and
				without raising one's voice is better. Once during a
				journey the Prophet, peace be upon him, heard a group of
				Muslims supplicating aloud. Thereupon the Prophet, peace
				be upon him, said, "Give yourselves a respite, you are
				not calling upon someone deaf or absent. Surely He Whom
				you are calling upon is near you and He listens to all.
				He is nearer to you than the neck of your mount." This
				hadith underlines the love and awe a person should feel
				while engaged in dhikr.
			</p>
			<p>
				A part of this etiquette is the requirement that a person
				wishing to do dhikr be clean in body and dress, and smell
				sweet and fragrant. This will give him a fresh zeal and
				he will feel invigorated. One should face the qiblah
				during dhikr, for the best assemblies are those that face

				Joining the assemblies or circles of dhikr is a

				Ibn 'Umar reported, "The Prophet, peace be upon him,

				yourselves of it.' The Companions asked, 'What are the
				gardens of Paradise, O Messenger of Allah? ' The Prophet,

				them they surround them'."

				Muslim reports that Mu'awiyyah said, "The Prophet, peace

				asked, 'What makes you sit here?' They said, 'We are
				sitting here in order to remember Allah and to praise Him
				because He guided us to the path of Islam and he
				conferred favors upon us.' Thereupon he adjured them by
				Allah and asked if that was the only purpose of their
				sitting there. 'They said, By Allah, we are sitting here
				for this purpose only. ' At this the Prophet, peace be
				upon him, said, 'I am not asking you to take an oath
				because of any misapprehension against you, but only
				because Gabriel came to me and informed me that Allah,
				the Exalted and Glorious, was telling the angels that He

				The Prophet, peace be upon him, visited one of the
				Muslims who had become as feeble as a chicken, and
				inquired about his health. Allah's Messenger, peace be
				him, asked, "Did you supplicate Allah for anything or beg
				Him for it?" He replied, "Yes, I asked in these words,
				'O, God punish me in this world with the punishment that
				You are going to inflict on me in the Hereafter'."
				Allah's Messenger, peace be upon him, remarked, "Hallowed
				be Allah! You have neither the power nor the forbearance
				to take upon yourself the burden of Allah's punishment.
				Why did you not say this, 'O Allah, grant us all the good
				of the world, and all the good of the Hereafter, and save

				Zaid ibn Arqam said, "I am not going to say anything
				except what Allah's Messenger, may peace be upon him,
				used to say. He used to supplicate, 'O Allah, I seek

			<p>
				The Prophet, peace be upon him, exclaimed to his

				Abual-'Aliyah said, "Allah's sending blessings to the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, means that He praises him in
				front of the angels, and the blessings of angels mean
				their supplications invoking blessings on the Prophet.'
				(Bukhari) Sufian Al-Thawri and other scholars said,
				"Blessings of the Lord mean His mercy, and the blessings
				of the angels refer to their supplications and seeking
				forgiveness." (Tirmidhi) Commenting on the Qur'anic verse
				33.56, Ibn Kathir said, "In this verse Allah, the
				Exalted, informed His servants about the revered status
				that His Prophet and servant occupies with Him in the
				higher assembly. He revealed that He praises him in the
				company of the angels close to Him, and that the angels
				pray for him, and that He has commanded the inhabitants
				of the lower world to send their salutations and
				greetings to the Prophet, so that the lower and the
				higher worlds would join together in his praise. On this
				subject there are many hadith. Some of these are given
				below:
			</p>
			<p>
				Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-'As reported that he heard the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, saying, "If anyone invokes

				him ten times over." (Muslim)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Mas'ud reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him,
				said, "The people nearest to me on the Day of Judgment
				will be the ones most conscientious in invoking blessings
				upon me." Tirmidhi reported this hadith, and he considers
				it a sound hadith. The words "nearest to me" here mean
				the ones most deserving of the Prophet's intercession and
				nearest to him in station.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet, peace be upon
				him, said, "Do not turn my grave into a site of
				festivities, but send greetings to me for your greetings
				are raised to me wherever you might be." (Reported by Abu
				Daw'ud with a sound chain of authorities)
			</p>
			<p>
				Aus reported that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said,
				"The best of your days is Friday, so send more and more
				greetings to me on it, for your greetings are presented
				to me." They asked, "How are our greetings presented to
				you while you are dead and your body is turned into
				dust?" He replied, "Allah has forbidden the earth to
				consume the bodies of the prophets." (Abu Daw'ud and
				Nasa'i)
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet, peace be upon

				returns my soul to me so that I may respond to his
				greetings." (Reported by Abu Daw'ud with a sound chain of
				authorities)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad recorded that Abu Talha Al Ansari said, "The
				Prophet, peace be upon him, woke up one day cheerful and
				beaming. His companions exclaimed, 'O Prophet of Allah,
				you woke up today cheerful and beaming.' He replied,
				'Yes! A messenger of Allah, the Mighty and the Glorified,

				a salutation, Allah will record for him ten good deeds,
				wipe off ten of his sins, and raise him thereby ten
				degrees in rank, and He will return his salutation with a
				similar salutation".' Ibn Kathir considers this a sound
				hadith.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet, peace be upon
				him, said, "Whoever desires to be given (his reward) in
				full measure, should send salutations to us - the members
				of my family - and should say, 'O Allah, shower blessings
				upon Muhammad, the Prophet, his wives, the mothers of the

				Ibrahim. You are the Praiseworthy and Glorious." (Related

			</p>

				Abu ibn Ka'ab said, "When two-thirds of the night had

				say, 'O people, remember Allah, remember Allah. The great
				commotion has come, followed by more commotions. Death
				has come with all that it has in store. Death has come
				with all that it has in store.' I said, 'O messenger of
				Allah, I invoke blessings to you a great deal. How much
				of my prayer should I reserve for invoking [such]
				blessings upon you?' The Prophet replied, 'Whatever you
				want.' I asked, 'A quarter of it?' He said, 'Whatever you
				wish. If you increase it, that would be better for you.'
				I asked, 'Half of it?' He repeated, 'Whatever you wish,
				but if you increase it, that would be better for you.' I
				asked, 'Two-thirds of it?' He said, 'Whatever you wish.
				If you increase it, that would be better for you.' I
				said, 'I devote my whole prayer to invoking blessings on

			<p>
				Some Muslim scholars hold that it is obligatory to send
				salutations to the Prophet, i.e. invoke blessings upon
				him, each time one hears his name mentioned. They, like
				Al-Tahawi and Al-Halimi, base their argument on a hadith
				recorded by Tirmidhi, which he grades as sound, from Abu
				Hurairah, that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "May
				the nose of the person in whose presence I am mentioned
				be covered with dirt if he does not invoke blessings upon
				me. And let the nose of that person be smeared with dust
				who finds the month of Ramadan but lets it come to an end
				without securing pardon for himself. And may the nose of
				the person be smeared wlth dust whose aged parents, both
				of them or one of them, are still living, and who fails
				them (i.e. by serving them) to enter Paradise." (Related
				by Tirmidhi, who said it is an authentic hadith)

				In a report related by Abu Dharr we read, "the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, said, 'The most miserly among people
				is the one who fails to invoke blessings upon me when my
				name is mentioned in his or her presence'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Other scholars are of the opinion that invoking Allah's
				blessings upon the Prophet, peace be upon him, only once
				while in a gathering is obligatory. After that it is no
				longer necessary, though it is preferred to do so. This
				is based on a hadith from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet,
				peace be upon him, said, "If some people sitting together
				in an assembly do not remember Allah in it, nor invoke
				Allah's blessings upon His Prophet, peace be upon him,
				they will be sorry on the Day of Judgment. Allah may
				either punish them or forgive them." (Tirmidhi)

				The scholars hold it desirable to invoke Allah's

		<section heading="Consultation and Istikharah Before Setting out on a Journey">
			<p>
				Istikhara (Arabic) means to ask Allah to guide one to the
				right thing concerning any affair in one's life,
				especially when one has to choose between two permissible
				alternatives. A traveller should consult good righteous
				persons before setting out on a journey, because Allah
				says, "And consult them (O Prophet) in affairs (of
				moment)," (Qur'an 3.159) and one of the characteristics
				of the believers is that "they (conduct) their affairs by
				mutual consultation" (Qur'an 42.38).
			</p>
			<p>
				Qatadah said, "Every people who seek the pleasure of
				Allah and consult with one another are guided to the best
				course in their affairs."
			</p>
			<p>
				The traveller should also make istikharah and seek
				guidance from Allah. Sa' d ibn Waqas reported that the
				Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "Istikharah (seeking
				guidance from Allah) is one of the distinct favors (of
				Allah) upon man, and a good fortune for the son of Adam
				is to be pleased with the judgment of Allah. And a
				misfortune of the son of Adam is his failure to make
				istikharah (seeking Allah's guidance), and a misfortune
				for the son of Adam is his displeasure with the judgment
				of Allah." Ibn Taimiyyah said, "He who seeks guidance
				from the Creator and consults the creatures will never
				regret it."

		<section heading="How to make Istikharah">
			<p>
				For this purpose one should pray two non-obligatory
				raka'at of prayer, even if they are of the regular sunnah
				prayers or a prayer for entering the mosque, and so on,
				during any time of the day or night. One should recite in
				them whatever one wishes of the Qur'an, after reciting
				al-Fatihah. Then one should praise Allah and invoke
				blessings upon the Prophet, peace be upon him. After this
				one should supplicate to Allah with the following
				supplication, which Jabir Ibn 'Abdullah has reported from
				the Prophet, peace be upon him, when he related, "The
				Prophet, peace be upon him, taught us how to make
				Istikharah in all (our) affairs, just as he taught us
				various surahs of the Qur'an. He told us, 'If anyone of
				you considers doing something he should offer a
				two-rak'at prayer other than the obligatory prayers, and
				then say (after the prayer), "Allahumma inni astakhiruka
				bi'ilmika. wa astaqdiruka bi-qudratika, wa as'aluka min
				fadlika al-azimfa-innaka taqdiru wala aqdiru, wa ta'lamu

				from Your knowledge, and Power from Your Might and I ask
				for Your great blessings. You are capable and I am not.
				You know and I do not and You know the unseen. O Allah!
				If You know that this thing is good for my din and my
				subsistence and for my Hereafter - (or say, If it is
				better for my present and later needs) - then ordain it
				for me and make it easy for me to obtain, and then bless
				me in it. If You know that this thing is harmful to me in

				it is worse for my present and later needs)--then keep it
				away from me, and keep me away from it. And ordain for me

				it)."' The Prophet, may peace be upon him, added that
				then the person should mention his need."
			</p>
			<p>
				There is nothing authentic concerning anything specific
				that is to be recited in the prayer nor is there any
				authentic report concerning how many times one should
				repeat it.
			</p>
			<p>
				An-Nawawi holds that "after making istikharah, a person
				must do what he is wholeheartedly inclined to do and
				feels good about doing and should not insist on doing
				what he had desired to do before making the istikharah.
				And if his feelings change, he should leave what he had
				intended to do, for otherwise he is not leaving the
				choice to Allah, and would not be honest in seeking aid
				from Allah's power and knowledge. Sincerity in seeking
				Allah's choice, means that one should completely abandon

				read that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Hasten
				to perform Hajj - the basic obligation - for you don't
				know what might happen to you," meaning "one may fall
				sick or be prevented by some other exigency." The earlier

		<section heading="Prerequisites for Hajj">
			<p>
				There is a consensus among jurists concerning the
				prerequisites that must be found in a person for Hajj to
				be incumbent on him:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					He must be a Muslim.
				</li>
				<li>
					He must be an adult.
				</li>
				<li>
					He must be of a sound state of mind.
				</li>
				<li>
					He must be free.
				</li>
				<li>
					He must have the necessary power and ability.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Anyone lacking any of these conditions is not obligated
				to perform Hajj. All these conditions, that is, being a
				Muslim, being of adult age and of sound mind, being free,
				and possessing the power to discharge a duty are equally
				valid with respect to all other forms of worship in
				Islam. This is based on a hadith of the Prophet (peace be
				upon him) which says: "Three persons are not to be held
				accountable: a sleeping person until he awakes, a minor
				until he comes of age, and a mentally disturbed person
				until he regains his reason."
			</p>
			<p>
				Freedom is an essential prerequisite for Hajj, for this
				worship needs time as well as financial ability. A slave
				lacks both, for all his time is spent in the service of
				his master, and financially he lacks the ability to
				undertake this obligation. The Qur'an says: "Pilgrimage
				thereto is a duty men owe to Allah - those who can afford
				the journey" (3.97).

		<section heading="THE ABILITY TO PERFORM HAJJ - WHAT DOES IT IMPLY?">
			<p>
				The ability to perform Hajj, which is one of its
				essential conditions, includes the following:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					A person must be healthy and physically fit. If
					one is disabled by old age or a disease that is
					incurable or is unable to perform Hajj for some
					other similar reason, he may, if he is
					financially capable, assign someone else to
					perform Hajj on his behalf and at his expense.
					This will be discussed later under "Hajj On
					Behalf of Another Person."
				</li>
				<li>
					The journey to Hajj must be safe so that the
					pilgrim's life and possessions are safe and
					secure from any danger. If one is afraid for
					one's life from highwaymen or an epidemic or if
					one is afraid to be robbed of one' s possessions,
					then such a one is deemed as one of those who
					cannot afford the journey for Hajj .
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				There is, however, a difference of opinion among scholars
				regarding the entry fees and other charges levied on
				pilgrims. Can a person be excused and reckoned as unable
				financially to perform Hajj because of these charges?
				AshShafi'i and others are of the view that the presence
				of these levies does qualify a person to be classified as
				unable to perform Hajj, even though the levy involved may
				be paltry. The Maliki scholars disagree for they do not
				regard this as a sufficient reason for a person to be
				deemed as unable to perform Hajj, unless the amount
				involved is too exorbitant or is demanded repeatedly.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for those who live in the vicinity of Makkah, this
				condition does not apply, for they are so close that they
				can go for Hajj on foot.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some ahadith explain the Qur'anic words "those who can
				afford the journey," (Qur'an 3.97) as meaning provision
				of food and means of journey. Anas reports that the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) when once asked about the
				meaning of "those who can afford" said: "It means
				possessing means of sustenance and transportation."
				(Ad-Daraqutni considers this hadith sound) Al-Hafiz
				remarks: "Most probably its chain of transmitters is not
				traceable to the Prophet (peace be upon him). Tirmidhi as
				well has reported it on the authority of Ibn 'Umar but
				its chain of transmitters is weak. Abdul Haqq remarked:
				"All its chains of transmitters are weak." Ibn Al-Mundhir
				says: "It is not traceable to the Prophet (peace be upon
				him) and the correct position is that it is a sound but
				incompletely transmitted hadith whose chain of
				authorities does not go back to the Prophet (peace be
				upon him)."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) once said: "He who possesses
				sufficient provisions and means of journey for the
				performance of Hajj and yet does not do so, let him die
				the death of a Jew or a Christian." For Allah says in the
				Qur' an: "Pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to Allah -
				those who can afford the journey." (Transmitted by
				Tirmidhi, but among the narrators of this hadith are
				included "Halal" ibn Abdullah, who is unknown, and
				"Al-Harith" whom Ash-Sha'abi and others have described as
				a liar)
			</p>
			<p>
				All these ahadith are weak in authority, yet most
				scholars regard provisions and means of journey as a
				necessary condition for Hajj. If a person has neither the
				necessary provisions nor means of travel, he is not
				obligated to perform Hajj.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Taimiyyah says: "These ahadith are musnad (A report
				which is traceable in uninterrupted ascending order of
				the narrators to its first authority) and have a sound
				chain of authorities, some are mursal (A hadith
				transmitted by a successor (atabi+), young or old,
				without mentioning the Companion who might have heard it
				from the Prophet directly. Ash-Shafi'i considers such a
				hadith weak, while Abu Hanifah and Malik consider it
				sound) and others are mauquf. (A hadith reported from a
				Companion through words or acts uninterruptedly or
				otherwise) They all prove that the ability to arrange
				one's provisions and possession of means of journey is a
				necessary prerequisite for Hajj, and this despite the
				fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) knew that many
				of the people (in his time) were able to go for Hajj on
				foot.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly the words of Allah: "Pilgrimage thereto is a
				duty men owe to Allah - those who can afford the journey"
				underline the fact that ability and power are the
				necessary prerequisite for all forms of worship. It
				signifies the unspecified power or a little bit more than
				what may be necessary. In the case of sawm (fasting) and
				salah (obligatory prayers) the financial ability is
				superfluous and is not specified in the Qur'an, unlike
				Hajj for which it is an important requirement. Similarly,
				Hajj is a form of worship which involves traveling for
				which one must be in possession of sufficient means to
				support oneself (and one' s family), as well as be able
				to shoulder the cost of the journey as in jihad.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this regard we may refer to the Qur'anic verse
				(9.91-92) "Nor is there any blame on those who find no
				resources to spend, nor is there (blame) on those who
				come to you to be provided with mounts, and when you
				said, 'I can find no mounts for you,."'
			</p>
			<p>
				In Al-Muhadhib we read: "If someone has the money to buy
				provisions and the passage to Hajj but he needs it to pay
				his debts, Hajj is not binding on him, whether the
				settlement of the debt is required immediately or is due
				after a time. The debts that are due for immediate
				settlement must be paid at once, whereas the Hajj may be
				performed later on in life. But if he spends all that he
				has on Hajj he may not be in a position to pay off his
				debt."
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, if one is in need of a dwelling or a servant
				to help him, he may be classified as unable to perform
				Hajj. Likewise, if one needs to take a wife because he
				fears he may not be able to avoid evil, he must get
				married, for it is his immediate need. Furthermore, if
				one needs goods for his business to obtain requisite
				resources therefrom, such a one, according to Abul
				'Abbas, Ibn Sarih, may be classified as unable to perform
				Hajj in view of his specific need. Al-Mughni says: "If
				the debt is owed to a wealthy person who does not demand
				immediate settlement of the loan, defers settlement to a
				later stage, and is ready to permit the debtor to proceed
				for Hajj, then such a debtor is (technically) able to
				perform Hajj. But in case the lender cannot afford to
				defer settlement of the loan, the debtor would be
				reckoned as unable to perform Hajj."
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the Shafi'i school: "If someone offers
				another a free passage for Hajj, one is not obliged to
				accept the offer, for it is a favor and involves distress
				of being obliged to another person. If, however, such an
				offer is made by one' s son to perform Hajj, then one is
				obligated to do so, for one can perform it without being
				beholden to anyone else."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanbali school is of the view that an offer of
				financial help by someone else does not obligate a person
				to perform Hajj, nor does this classify him as
				(financially) capable of performing it, whether the offer
				comes from a stranger or a relative and whether the offer
				provides means of travel and provision, or linanacial
				help as such.

				Though Hajj is not compulsory for these two groups it is
				quite valid if they perform one, but it will not suffice
				them as regards the Hajj prescribed in Islam.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas reports: "The Prophet (peace be upon him)
				said: 'Any minor (child) who performs Hajj must perform
				it again after coming of age; any slave who performs Hajj
				and is then freed, must perform his Hajj again'."
				(Reported by At-Tabarani on sound authority) As-Sa'ib bin
				Yazid says: "My father performed Hajj with the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) who was performing his Farewell Hajj,
				while I was only seven years old." This was reported by
				Ahmad, Bukhari and Tirmidhi, who noted: "All scholars
				agree that if a minor performs Hajj, he must repeat his
				Hajj upon coming of age. Likewise a slave who performs
				Hajj, and thereafter gains his freedom, must also repeat
				his Hajj if he is in a position to do so."
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also reported from Ibn 'Abbas that during a Hajj a
				woman lifted a boy, and asked the Prophet, "Will this boy
				be rewarded for Hajj?" The Prophet (peace be upon him)
				answered: "Yes, and you too will be rewarded." (The boy
				will be rewarded for his obedience, while the mother will
				be rewarded for helping and instructing him to perform
				Hajj. This hadith is also reported from 'Umar)
			</p>
			<p>
				Jabir reports: "We performed Hajj with the Prophet (peace
				be upon him) and a number of women and children were with
				us. We said talbiyah on behalf of the children, and
				(also) threw pebbles on their behalf. This is narrated by
				Ahmad and Ibn Majah.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a minor is able he may himself declare the state of
				ihram and perform the rites of Hajj. Otherwise, his
				guardian (An-Nawawi said: "The guardian who declares the
				state of ihram on behalf of a non-discerning minor, is
				the guardian of his properties, i.e., his father,
				grandfather, or the guardian appointed by law. Conceming
				the mother, the scholars differ. Some are of the opinion
				that her ihram on his behalf is only valid if she is
				appointed by law as his guardian. Others claim that her
				ihram is valid even if she is not the guardian) must
				declare the state of ihram and say talbiyah on his
				behalf, circumambulate round Ka'bah, run between Safa and
				Marwah, stay at 'Arafah and throw stones on his behalf.
				If, on the other hand, a minor attains the age of puberty
				on or before the Day of 'Arafah, his Hajj is then
				credited to him. The same applies to a slave who is
				liberated on or before the Day of 'Aratah. Malik and Ibn
				Al-Mundhir say: "To both of these people their Hajj
				cannot be credited as (replacement for) the obligatory
				Hajj, for they intended a supererogatory worship while
				putting on ihram; its supererogatory status cannot be
				transformed into an obligatory worship."

			<p>
				It is desirable for a woman to seek her husband's
				permission for the prescribed Hajj. Then if he grants her
				the permission she may leave for Hajj; in case he refuses
				to give permission, she may still proceed for Hajj, for a
				husband should not forbid his wife from performing
				obligatory Hajj. It is an obligatory act of worship. It
				is unlawful to obey anyone in something that involves
				disobedience to Allah. A woman should perform obligatory
				Hajj as soon as possible, just as she should offer her
				prescribed daily prayers at their earliest prescribed
				times. In either case a husband has no right to prevent
				his wife from doing what is her obligatory duty. The same
				applies when a wife has vowed a Hajj, because it is
				obligatory like the prescribed Hajj. In the case of
				supererogatory Hajj, however, the husband may prevent his
				wife, and the wife must obey her husband. This is
				supported by a hadith reported by AdDaraqutni on the
				authority of Ibn 'Umar who narrated that while speaking
				about a wealthy lady whose husband had refused to give
				her permission to perform Hajj, the Prophet (peace be

		<section heading="He Who Dies Without Performing Obligatory Hajj">
			<p>
				If a person dies before performing obligatory Hajj or if
				one vowed to perform Hajj but died before fulfilling one'
				s vow, his heir must assign someone to perform Hajj on
				behalf of the deceased. All the ensuing expenses in this
				regard must be paid out of the deceased's property, as
				indeed must be any debts left by him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas narrates that a woman from the tribe of
				Johainah came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and
				said: "My mother had vowed to perform Hajj but she died
				before fulfilling her vow, should I perform Hajj on her
				behalf? The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Yes,
				perform Hajj on her behalf. Would you not pay off any
				debts your mother might have left behind upon her death?
				Pay off what you owe to Allah, for He is most deserving
				of settlement of His debt." (Bukhari)
			</p>
			<p>
				This hadith underlines the obligation of performing Hajj
				on behalf of a deceased person, whether or not he leaves
				a will to this effect (it is a kind of debt for the
				deceased), and all debts left by the deceased must be
				settled, just as all other financial obligations such as
				zakah, an atonement or a vow transacted by the deceased
				has to be fulfilled.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas, Zaid bin Thabit, Abu Hurairah, and
				Ash-Shafi'i hold this opinion. They consider that the
				expenses of the substitute (the hired person) must be
				paid out of the wealth of the deceased before dividing it
				up among his heirs.
			</p>
			<p>
				In case the wealth is insufficient to cover both the cost
				of Hajj (by the substitute) and settlement of the
				deceased's debts, the expense of Hajj must be paid first,
				as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Allah is most
				deserving that His debt be paid back."
			</p>
			<p>
				Imam Malik says: "A person may perform Hajj on behalf of
				the deceased only if the deceased leaves a will to that
				effect. If the deceased leaves no such will, then a Hajj
				on his behalf may not be performed, for this worship
				involves, more than anything else, physical exertion and
				struggle and as such, no other person can replace or
				substitute another person. If a deceased makes a will
				regarding it, then Hajj may be performed, meeting all its
				cost from out of one third of the share of his heritage."

				If someone has the ability to perform Hajj but afterwards

				must arrange for someone else to perform Hajj on his

				this respect, such a person is very much like the
				deceased, hence the permission for him to choose his
				substitute in Hajj.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is based on a hadith reported by Al-Fadl ibn 'Abbas,
				who says: "A woman of Khath'am said, 'O Prophet of Allah!
				Allah has prescribed Hajj for His servants. (Now that) I
				am grown up, I find that my father is an old man, and he
				cannot ride on the camel (for long). Should I perform
				Hajj on his behalf?' The Prophet (peace be upon him)
				said: 'Yes.'" This happened during the Farewell Hajj.
				(Reported by the Group) Tirmidhi considers it a sound
				hadith with a sound chain and adds: "On this topic,
				reports other than this hadith are also found; they are
				of sound authority, and the companions of the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) believed and practiced accordingly;
				they held that one may perform Hajj on behalf of a
				deceased person." At-Thawri, Ibn al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi'i,
				Ahmad and Ishaq also hold a similar view.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imam Malik says: "If the deceased leaves a will that

				Ash-Shafi'i say that it is permissible for an old man,
				who is unable to perform Hajj on his own, to arrange for
				a substitute to do it on his behalf.
			</p>
			<p>
				The above hadith also lends support to the view that,

				If a sick person recovers after someone has performed

				one). This is Imam Ahmad's view.
			</p>
			<p>
				The majority of scholars are, however, of the view that
				such a substitutory Hajj will not suffice a man to
				absolve him of his obligation, for his recovery shows
				that his case was not really hopeless (and he should
				therefore repeat it), for the decisive factor in this
				respect is cessation of illness and restoration of his
				health.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Hazim is inclined to the first view. He says: "When
				the Prophet (peace be upon him) commanded to perform Hajj
				on behalf of those who are unable to walk or ride (i.e.,
				cannot travel for Hajj), and told that this will pay off

				prescribed, the people used to trade at Mina, 'Arafah,
				and the market place of Dhul-Majaz (A place close to
				'Arafah) during the Hajj season, but they feared it might
				be forbidden for them while in a state of ihram.
				Thereupon Allah revealed the verse (Qur'an 2.198): "It is
				no crime in you if you seek of the bounty of your Lord
				(during pilgrimage)." This is reported by Bukhari, Muslim
				and Nasa'i.
			</p>
			<p>
				Commenting on the above verse, Ibn 'Abbas adds: "The
				people used to shun business while in Mina, so they were
				instructed to engage in business or trade while pouring
				down from 'Arafah.''ls Abu Omamah At-Taimi narrates that
				he said to Ibn 'Umar: "I rent mounts to people during
				Hajj season, and the people tell me that my Hajj is
				void." Ibn 'Umar asked him: "Do you not don Hajj garb,
				say talbiyah, go around the House of Allah, pour down
				from 'Arafah, and stone the Satan?" The man said, "Yes, I
				do." Ibn 'Umar said: "Then your Hajj is quite valid (and
				you will be rewarded for it). A person came to the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) and asked him something
				similar to what you asked me, whereupon the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) remained silent until this verse
				(Qur'an 2.198) was revealed to him: "It is no crime in
				you if you seek the bounty of your Lord (during Hajj
				season)." Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent for
				the man and recited the verse to him, saying: "Your Hajj
				is valid." This is reported by Abu Daw'ud and Sa'id ibn
				Mansur. Al-Hafiz Al-Mundhri said Abu Omamah is not known
				(as a narrator).
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas says that a man asked him: "I hire myself to
				these people to guide them in performing their rites of
				Hajj; will I have a reward for Hajj?" Ibn 'Abbas said:
				"Yes." (And then he recited) "To these will be allotted
				what they have earned; and Allah is quick in account.''
				(Qur'an 2.202) This is transmitted by Al-Baihaqi and
				Ad-Daraqutni.

			<p>
				Muslim reports: "Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaibah and Ishaq bin
				Ibrahim told us that Hatem bin Isma'il al-Madani reported
				of Ja'far bin Mohammad and he of his father, saying, 'We
				visited Jabir bin Abdullah (he was blind) and he began
				inquiring about the people (who had come to see him) till
				it was my turn. I said: "I am Mohammad ibn Ali ibn
				Hussein." He placed his hand on my head and opened my
				upper button and then the lower one, and then placed his
				hand on my chest (in order to bless me). I was during
				those days a young boy, and then he said: "You are
				welcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want to ask." I
				asked him a question but it was time for prayer. He stood
				up covering himself in his mantle. Whenever he placed its
				ends upon his shoulders they slipped down because it was
				short (in size). Another mantle was, however, Iying on
				the clothes rack nearby (and he put it on) and led the
				prayer. I said to him: "Tell me about the Hajj of the
				Prophet (peace be upon him)." He held up his nine fingers
				and said: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) stayed in
				Madinah for nine years but did not perform Hajj. Then, in
				the tenth year he made a public announcement to the
				effect that Allah's Messenger was about to perform the
				Hajj. A large number of people came to Madinah, and all
				of them were eager to emulate the Prophet (peace be upon
				him) and follow his actions.
			</p>
			<p>
				"We set out with him until we reached Dhul-Hulaifah,
				where Asma bint 'Umais gave birth to Mohammad ibn Abi
				Bakr. She sent a message to the Prophet (peace be upon
				him) asking him: "What should I do?" He said, "Take a
				bath, bandage your private parts and put on ihram.
			</p>
			<p>
				"The Prophet (peace be upon him) then prayed in the
				mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it
				stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida. As far as I
				could see in front of me, behind me, on my right and on
				my left, I saw riders and pedestrians. The Messenger of
				Allah (peace be him) was prominent among us and the
				(revelation) of the Qur'an was descending upon him, and
				it is he who knows (its true) interpretation. Whatever he
				did, we also did.
			</p>
			<p>
				He pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying): Labbaika
				Allahumma labbaik labbaika la sharika laka labbaik, innal
				hamda wan-ni'mata laka wal mulk, la sharika lak (O Allah!
				I hasten to You. You have no partner. I hasten to You.
				All praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too;
				You have no partner). And the people also pronounced this
				talbiyah which they pronounce today. The Messenger of
				Allah (peace be upon him) did not disapprove of anything
				in it, but he adhered to his own talbiyah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jabir said: "We did not have any other intention but that
				of Hajj only, being unaware of the 'Umrah, but when we
				came with him to the House (of Allah), he touched the
				Black Stone (Hajar al Aswad) and made seven circuits,
				running three of them and walking four. Then going to the
				Station of Ibrahim, he recited: "And adopt the Station of
				Ibrahim as a place of prayer.'' (Qur'an 2.125) He stood
				at a place where the Station (of Ibrahim) was between him
				and the House. There he prayed two rak'ahs reciting Surah
				Al-lkhlas, and Surah Al-Kafirun. He then returned to the
				Black Stone (Hajar al A.sl~ad) and kissed it. Then he
				went out of the gate to Safa, and as he approached it he
				recited: "Al-Safa and al-Marwah are among the signs
				appointed by Allah," (Qur'an 2.15) (adding:) I begin with
				what Allah began. He first mounted Safa until he saw the
				House, and facing Qiblah he declared the Oneness of Allah
				and glorified Him and said: La ilaha illa Allah wahdahu
				la sharika lahu, lahul mulk wa lahul hamd, wa huwa 'ala
				kulli sha'in qadeer, la ilaha illallahu wahdahu anjaza
				wa'dahu, wa nasara 'abdahu, wa hazamal ahzaba wahdah
				(There is no God but Allah, One, He has no partner. His
				is the Sovereignty, to Him praise is due, and He is
				Powerful over everything. There is no God but Allah
				alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and
				routed the confederates alone").
			</p>
			<p>
				He said these words three times making supplications in
				between. He then descended and walked towards Marwah, and
				when his feet touched the bottom of the valley, he ran;
				and when he began to ascend, he walked till he reached
				Marwah. There he did as he had done at Safa.
			</p>
			<p>
				"When it was his last round of Marwah he said: 'If I had
				known beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I
				would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have
				offered it as an 'Umrah. So, he among you who has not the
				sacrificial animals with him should put off ihram and
				treat it as an 'Umrah. Suraqa ibn Malik ibn Ju'tham got
				up and said, 'Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the
				present year, or does it apply forever? Thereupon the
				Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) intertwined the
				fingers (of one hand) into another and said twice: 'The
				'Umrah has become incorporated in the Hajj,' (adding):
				'No, but forever and ever.'
			</p>
			<p>
				"Ali came from Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) and found Fatimah (Allah be
				pleased with her) to be one among those who had put olf
				ihram. put on dyed clothes, and had applied kuhl*. Ali
				showed diiapproval of it, whereupon she said: 'My father
				has commanded me to do this.' (The narrator) said that
				Ali used to say in Iraq: 'I went to the Messenger of
				Allah (peace be upon him) showing annoyance at Fatimah
				for what she had done, and asked the Prophet (peace be
				upon him) regarding what she had narrated from him, and
				told him that he was angry with her, whereupon the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'She has told the
				truth; she has told the truth.'
			</p>
			<p>
				"(The Prophet then asked Ali): 'What did you say when you
				put on ihram?' I (Ali) said: 'O Allah, I am putting on
				ihram for the same purpose as Your Messenger has put it
				on.' Thereupon the Prophet (peace be upon him) told him,
				'I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off
				the ihram.'
			</p>
			<p>
				"(Jabir) said: 'The total number of those sacrificial
				animals brought by Ali from Yemen and of those brought by
				the Prophet (peace be upon him) was one hundred. All the
				people except the Prophet (peace be upon him) and those
				who had with them sacrificial animals, put off ihram and
				got their hair clipped. When it was the day of Tarwiya
				(8th of Dhul-Hijjah) they went to Mina and put on the
				ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon
				him) rode and led there, the noon, afternoon, sunset,
				'Isha and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the
				sun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be
				pitched at Namira.
			</p>
			<p>
				"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) then set out
				and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at
				Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraish used
				to do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah
				(peace be upon him), however, passed on till he came to
				'Arafah and he found that the tent had been pitched for
				him at Namira. There he got down till the sun had passed
				the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa be brought and
				saddled for him. Then he came to the bottom of the
				valley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your
				blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the
				sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours,
				in this town of yours.
			</p>
			<p>
				Behold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is
				under my feet, and completely abolished. Abolished are
				also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance. The
				first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is
				that of the son of Rabi 'a ibn al-Harith, who was nursed
				among the tribe of Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. And the
				usury of the pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the
				first of our usury I abolish is that of 'Abbas ibn 'Abd
				al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them
				on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has
				been made lawful unto you by word of Allah. You too have
				rights over them, in that they should not allow anyone to
				sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do
				that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their
				rights upon you are that you should provide them with
				food and clothing in a fitting manner.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold
				fast to it, you will never go astray. And you will be
				asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell
				me) what would you say? They (the audience) said: "We
				will bear witness that you have conveyed (the message),
				discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise
				(sincere) counsel." He (the narrator) said: "He (the Holy
				Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and
				pointing it at the people (said): 'O Allah, be witness. O
				Allah be witness,' saying it thrice' ."
			</p>
			<p>
				"Then adhan was pronounced and later on iqama and the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) led the noon prayer. Then
				another Iqama was pronounced and the Prophet (peace be
				upon him) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no
				other prayer in between the two. (This proves the
				validity of joining Zuhr and 'Asr prayer on this day, at
				this place. There is consensus on it, but there is
				disagreement as to its cause. Abu Hanifah and some
				Shafi'i scholars hold that it is a part of Hajj, but the
				majority of Shafi+i scholars hold it is due to journey)
				The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) then mounted
				his camel and came to the place where he was to stay. He
				made his she-camel, al-Qaswa, turn towards the rocky
				side, with the pedestrian path Iying in front of him. He
				faced the Qiblah, and stood there until the sun set, and
				the yellow light diminished somewhat, and the disc of the
				sun totally disappeared. He made Usama sit behind him,
				and pulled the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its
				head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under
				perfect control), and pointing out with his right hand,
				advised the people to be moderate (in speed) saying: "O
				people! calmness, calmness!" Whenever he passed over an
				elevated tract of land, he slightly loosened the
				nose-string of his camel till she climbed up. This is how
				he reached al-Muzdalifah."
			</p>
			<p>
				"There he led the evening and 'Isha prayers with one
				adhan and two iqamas and did not glorify (Allah) in
				between them (i.e. he did not observe supererogatory rak
				'ahs between Maghrib and 'Isha prayers). The Messenger of
				Allah (peace be upon him) then lay down til1 dawn and
				offered the dawn prayer with an adhan and iqama when the
				morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa, and
				when he came to Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram, he faced Qiblah, and
				supplicated to Allah, Glorified Him, and pronounced His
				Uniqueness and Oneness, and kept standing till the
				daylight was very clear.
			</p>
			<p>
				"He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated
				behind him was Al-Fadl ibn 'Abbas, who wa.s a man with
				beautiful hair, fair complexion, and handsome face. As
				the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) moved on, a
				group of women riding camels was also passing. Al-Fadl
				began to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (peace be
				upon him) placed his hand on Al-Fadl's face who then
				turned his face to the other side, and began to look, and
				the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) turned his
				hand to the other side and placed it on Al-Fadl's face.
				He again turned his face to the other side till he came
				to the bottom of Muhassir. He urged her (al-Qaswa) a
				little, and, following the middle road, (This proves that
				it is sunnah to follow a different road on the way back
				from Arafah than the one taken while going toward it. The
				Prophet (peace be upon him) went by the Dab road to
				Arafah. Similarly he used to take different routes going
				to or coming back from 'Eid prayers) which comes out at
				the greatest Jamarah, he came to the Jamarah which is
				near the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles,
				saying, 'Allahu Akbar' while throwing every one of them
				in a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown
				(holding them with fingers) and this he did while at the
				bottom of the valley. (That is, he stood there at a place
				where Mina, Arafah and Al-Muzdalifah were on his right,
				and Makkah on his left side)
			</p>
			<p>
				"He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed
				sixty-three (camels) with his own hand. He shared the
				remaining camels with Ali, who sacrificed them. He then
				commanded that a piece of meat from each sacrificed
				animal be put in a pot. When it was cooked, both of them
				(the Prophet and Ali) ate some of it and drank its soup.
			</p>
			<p>
				"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) again rode
				and came to the House (of Allah), where he performed
				Tawaf Al-Ifadah and oftered the Zuhr prayer at Makkah. He
				came to the tribe of 'Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying
				water at Zamzam, and said: 'Draw water, O Banu 'Abd
				al-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this
				right of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it
				along with you.' So they handed him a bucket and he drank
				from it."
			</p>
			<p>
				The scholars said: "This hadith is one of its kind. It
				contains lots of valuable information." Al-Qadi 'Iyad
				said: "Many scholars have spoken (and written) at great
				length about the legal injunctions contained in this
				hadith." Abu Bakr ibn Al-Mundhir has listed a large part
				of these identifying about one hundred and fifty
				injuctions. He observes that if he had analysed more
				closely this number would almost double.
			</p>
			<p>
				The scholars said: This hadith indicates that for the
				women giving birth to a child or having monthly periods
				it is sunnah - and much more so for others - to take a
				bath when they intend to perform Hajj or 'Umrah. It also
				teaches us that the women who are menstruating or are
				still in their confinement after childbirth, should clean
				themselves properly, cover their private parts with a
				piece of cotton, then declare their ihram. It also
				indicates that ihram must be declared after offering
				either a fard or a supererogatory prayer. After declaring
				ihram one should utter talbiyah loudly and preferably use
				the same words as used by the Prophet (peace be upon
				him). However, there is no harm in adding similar phrases
				as 'Umar did: "O Allah! I answer Your call, You Who gives
				blessings and good favors. I answer Your call fearing
				You, and wishing Your favor."
			</p>
			<p>
				This hadith also indicates that a pilgrim must first come
				to Makkah where one must perform circumambulation of
				arrival in Makkah (Tawaf qudoom), and touch the Black
				Stone--if possible--and make the first three rounds
				running, while making the other four walking at normal
				speed. The running is done around the Ka'bah except
				between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone.
			</p>
			<p>
				After making the Tawaf one must go to the Station of
				Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and recite the verse: "Take
				the Station of Ibrahim as a place for prayer." Then
				standing there, with the Station of Ibrahim between him
				and the Ka'bah, he should pray two rak'ahs reciting after
				Al-Fatihah, Surah Al-Kafirun in the first rak'ah, and
				Surah Al-lkhlas in the second rak'ah. This hadith also
				indicates that touching the Black Stone again prior to
				leaving the Sacred Mosque is recommended (if possible),
				just as one did upon entering it. There is consensus
				among the scholars that touching (kissing) the Black
				Stone is sunnah.
			</p>
			<p>
				After that, one must make Sa'i and for this purpose go to
				mount Safa. climb it, face the Ka'bah and make
				supplications three times to Allah. Then. one must climb
				down and walk toward Marwah, while jogging in the marked
				area called bainal milain between Safa and Marwah every
				time one passes this area during the seven rounds not
				just in the first three rounds as in Tawaf. On reaching
				Marwah one should climb it just as one climbed Safa, make
				supplications, and make remembrance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Completion of all these rites will complete one's 'Umrah.
				Now one should either shave one's head or clip some of
				one's hair to get out of the state of ihram. This is
				precisely what the Companions of the Prophet (peace be
				upon him) did when the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				commanded them to change their Hajj to 'Umrah. As for the
				pilgrim who is combining Hajj and 'Umrah, he must not
				shave or clip his hair, but should remain in his state of
				ihram.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the 8th of Dhul-Hij jah. those who had put off their
				ihram after making 'Umrah, should again put on ihra77l to
				perform pilgrimage, and then head to Mina with those who
				combine Hajj and 'Umrah. It is sunnah to offer the five
				daily prayers in Mina and to spend the night of the 9th
				of Dhul-Hijjah there.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also sunnah not to leave Mina for 'Arafah until
				after the sunrise, and not to enter 'Arafah until the sun
				begins to decline, and after ot'fering both Zuhr and 'Asr
				prayers, which the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered at
				Namira which is not a part of 'Arafah. The Prophet (peace
				be upon him) did not enter his quarters at 'Arafah until
				after otfering Zuhr and 'Asr prayers. Moreover, it is
				also sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to offer
				some supererogatory (nawafil) prayers in between these
				two prayers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The imam should give a sermon before the prayer, which is
				one of the sunnah sermons in pilgrimage. The second
				sermon is given by the imam on the 7th of Dhul-Hijjah
				after Zuhr prayer in the Ka'bah. The third of these
				sunnah sermons is delivered on the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah,
				the day of slaughtering. And the fourth sermon is given
				on the day the people leave (yawm an-nafr)--the 11th day
				of Dhul-Hijjah.
			</p>
			<p>
				This hadith also contains some important manners and
				etiquette for performing Hajj and 'Umrah:
			</p>
			<p>
				One is thereafter permitted to engage in any lawful
				activity that was unlawful for him while in the state of
				ihram, including sexual intercourse with one's wife. A
				person who has thrown pebbles at Jamarah al- 'Aqabah, but
				has not performed the circumambulation of if adah (or
				ziyarah) may engage in any lawful activity except sexual
				intercourse with his wife.
			</p>
			<p>
				That is the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				concerning Hajj. It explains what he meant when,
				according to a hadith, he said: "Take your rites from
				me," for his Hajj alone is the real and true Hajj.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the following pages we will deal in detail with all
				these rites, and the opinions of various scholars
				concerning them.

		<section heading="Fixed Time For Ihram, Mawaquit">
			<p>
				This refers to the specific period of time when the rites
				of Hajj have to be performed to be valid. This is clear
				from the words of Allah: "They ask you concerning the new
				moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of
				time (in the affairs of) men, and for Hajj'' l and "For
				Hajj are the months well-known." (Qur'an 2.197) The
				Muslim scholars are agreed that the months of Hajj are
				the months of Shawwal and Dhul-Qui'dah. They differ about
				the month of Dhul-Hijjah, whether only the first ten days
				of it are included in the months of Hajj or the entire
				month. Ibn 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn Mas'ud, the Hanafi and
				Shafi'i school, and Ahmad are of the opinion that only
				its first ten days are included in the months of Hajj,
				while Malik holds the entire month of DhulHijjah as one
				of the Hajj months. Ibn Hazm supports Malik's opinion,
				saying that the words, "For Hajj are the months
				well-known," does not mean two months and a part of other
				months.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly we know that of the rites of Hajj, the throwing
				of pebbles at jamarah takes place on the 13th of
				Dhul-Hijjah, while the scholars agree that the
				circumambulation of Ifadah, which is one of the essential
				rites of Hajj, may be performed anytime in the month of
				Dhul-Hijjah. There is no disagreement on this point. It
				is, therefore, quite correct to say that all three months
				are the months of Hajj.
			</p>
			<p>
				The effects of disagreement are apparent mainly in the
				rites performed after slaughtering the sacrificial
				animal. Those who consider the entire month of
				Dhul-Hijjah a Hajj month, hold there is no penalty for
				delay in slaughtering an animal. On the other hand, those
				who hold that only its first ten days are included in the
				period of Hajj are of the opinion that such a person must
				offer a penalty and offer a sacrifice for delay.

			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn 'Umar, Jabir and Ash-Shafi'i are of the
				opinion that donning the garb of ihram for Hajj is not
				valid outside its months. (Anyone putting on ihram before
				the months of Hajj may, however, perform 'Umrah, but tbis
				cannot be a substitute for his ihram for Hajj)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar said, "The months of Hajj are Shawwal,
				Dhul-Qui'dah and ten days of Dhul-Hijjah." Ibn 'Abbas
				said: "The sunnah is to declare one's intention and to
				put on ihram with the intention of performing Hajj during
				the months of Hajj." (Bukhari)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Jarir reported from Ibn 'Abbas that he said: "To put
				on ihram for Hajj is not valid except in the months of
				Hajj."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafites, Malik, and Ahmad are of the opinion that
				to put on ihram for Hajj betore its months is permissible
				but disliked. Ash-Shawkani, however, preferred the first
				opinion. He observes: "Allah, the Exalted One, has named
				specific months for Hajj rites, of which ihram is one. So
				whosoever claims that it is permissible to put on ihram
				even before these months must produce evidence to support
				his claim."

			<p>
				Mawaqit of place are the specific places where a pilgrim
				or a person intending to visit Makkah for 'Umrah or Hajj
				must declare his intention to do so and put on ihram, the
				pilgrim garb. Anyone intending to perform Hajj or 'Umrah
				must not pass beyond these places without ihram.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself specified these
				places:
			</p>
			<p>
				For the people of Madinah the miqat (singular of mawaqit)
				is DhalHalaifah, a place 450 kilometres to the north of
				Makkah, from where they must declare their intention and
				don the ihram, the Hajj garb.
			</p>
			<p>
				For those coming from Syria, Jordan, Palestine and
				Lebanon, the miqat is Al-Juhfah, a place 187 kilometres
				to the north-west of Makkah, and close to Rabigh, which
				is 204 kilometres from Makkah. Rabigh became the miqat
				for the people coming from Syria and Egypt, after the
				settlement of Al-Juhfah disappeared completely.
			</p>
			<p>
				The miqat for people of Najd is Qarn al Manazil, a
				mountain 94 kilometres to the east of Makkah, overlooking
				'Arafah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yalamlam, a mountain 54 kilometres to the south of Makkah
				is the miqat for those coming from Yemen. Here they must
				declare their intention and put on ihram.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the people of Iraq, the miqat is Dhat Irq, a place 94
				kilometres to the north-east of Makkah.
			</p>

				Ihram is the intention to perform either Hajj or 'Umrah,

				Tamattu' means performing 'Umrah during the Hajj season,

				pilgrim has the added advantage of performing Hajj and
				'Umrah in the same journey without having to go back
				home, and also because such a pilgrim after the 'Umrah,
				enjoys normal life; he can wear his usual clothes, apply
				perfume, and do other things until the time he once again
				puts on his Hajj garb for the Hajj.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyone intending to make a tamattu' should on approaching
				the miqat, first make intention for 'Umrah. While
				uttering talbiyah he should say: Labbaik bil 'Umrah. "O
				Allah, I answer Your call to perform 'Umrah." Such a
				pilgrim should keep on his or her Hajj garb until he
				circumambulates around the Ka'bah, walks between Safa and

				The scholars disagree as to which of these is the best
				kind. The Shafi'i school holds that ifrad and tamattu'
				are superior to qiran, because in either of the former
				two kinds a pilgrim has the opportunity to perform
				complete rites of Hajj and of 'Umrah. On the other hand,
				a qarin (one who undertakes a qiran Hajj) is able to
				perform Hajj only.
			</p>
			<p>
				As to which of the two--tamattu' or ifrad--is better,
				there are two opinions. One group of scholars holds
				tamattu' as superior to ifrad, while the others hold
				ifrad is better.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafi school holds that qiran is better than
				tamattu' and ifrad, and that tamattu ' is better than if
				rad. The Maliki school holds that if rad (Hajj only) is
				better than tamattu' and qiran. The Hanbali scholars, on
				the other hand, are of the view that tamattu' (combining

				the qiran and ifrad. This is comparatively easy and the

			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, this is what the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				performed himself and commanded his Companions to do

				ihram, saying, "Terminate your state of ihram and go to

				he permitted us. We said: 'There are only five days left
				to the Day of 'Arafah. Shall we go to 'Arafah while semen
				is dribbling from our male organs?" The Prophet (peace be
				upon him) stood up and said: "You know that I fear Allah
				the most, and that I am the most truthful, and the most
				pious amongst you. If I had not brought my sacrificial
				animals with me, I also would have terminated my state of
				ihram. If I were to again come (to Makkah), I shall not

		<section heading="Tawaf and Sa'i for those Performing Qirarl and Tamattu' - The People Living Within the Sacred Precincts of Ka'bah May Perform Ifrad (Hajj only).">
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas was once asked about the break between 'Umrah
				and Hajj to which he replied: "The Muhajirun (immigrants
				from Makkah), the Ansar (people of Madinah), and the
				wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) declared their
				intention to perform the Farewell Hajj. So we also
				declared our intention to do the same. Upon arrival in
				Makkah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Make your
				declaration of intention for 'Umrah only, except for
				those who have already designated their sacrificial
				animals, and brought them along with them." We made Tawaf
				of Ka'bah, walked seven times between Safa and Marwah.
				Then we consorted with our wives and wore our regular
				clothes. The Prophet (peace be upon him) further told us:
				"Those who have garlanded (i.e., marked) their
				sacrificial animals, they must not break their state of
				ihram until the animal reaches the slaughter house to be
				offered in sacrifice. Then we were commanded by the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) to declare our intention for
				Hajj on the night of the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. After
				completing all the rites of Hajj, we went and
				circumambulated around the Kabbah, walked between Safa
				and Marwah, and thus we completed Hajj and we offered the
				sacrifice as Allah says, "If anyone wishes to continue
				the 'Umrah onto the Hajj, he must make an offering such
				as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should
				fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his
				return ... (to his country)." (Qur'an 2.196) Offering a
				sheep in sacrifice is enough for this purpose. These
				Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) combined
				two worships in one year: Hajj and 'Umrah. Allah has
				mentioned it in His Book and (reinforced it) by the
				practice of His Prophet (peace be upon him), making it
				permissible for all people, excepting the residents of
				Makkah. Allah says (Qur'an 2.136): "This is for those
				whose household is not in (the precincts of) the Sacred
				Mosque." The Hajj months referred to are Shawwal,
				Dhul-Qui'dah and DhulHijjah. So whosoever combines an
				'Umrah and Hajj during these months has to offer a
				sacrifice, or observe fast. This is reported by Bukhari.
			</p>
			<p>
				This hadith proves that the residents of Makkah can
				neither perform qiran nor tamattu'. They may perform if
				rad only--a single Hajj or a single 'Umrah. This is the
				opinion of Ibn 'Abbas, and Abu Hanifah in the light of
				Allah' s words, "This is for those whose household is (in
				the precincts of) the Sacred Mosque."
			</p>
			<p>
				There is disagreement among scholars concerning "those
				whose household is (in the precincts) of the Sacred
				Mosque." Malik holds that they are the people of Makkah.
				Al-A'raj agrees with this view and also At-Tahawi who
				preferred this view. Ibn 'Abbas, Taw'us, and another
				group are of the opinion that it is the people living
				within the sacred precincts of Haram, which according to
				Al-Hafiz, is quite apparent. Ash-Shafi'i holds that any
				one living around Makkah at a distance not more than that
				at which one is permitted to shorten regular prayers is a
				resident of Makkah. Ibn Jarir agrees and prefers this
				view. The Hanafi scholars hold that all those living
				within or at the miqat are residents of Makkah. In this
				regard, the place of residence and not the place of birth
				of a person is taken into account.
			</p>
			<p>
				The above hadith also indicates that a person who
				performs Hajj tamattu' must first make a tawaf of Ka'bah
				and Sa'i between Safa and Marwah. This will suffice him
				for tawaful qudum (circumambulation of arrival) which is
				performed as a greeting to the Sacred Mosque upon arrival
				there. Then, after the Day of 'Arafah, such a person
				shall make another tawaf, tawaf ifada. and perform
				another Sa'i between Safa and Marwah.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the qarin, the pilgrim who combines 'Umrah and
				Hajj and remains in a state of ihram after the first
				'Umrah, the scholars are of the opinion that he needs to
				perform only one tawaf (seven circumambulations around
				Ka'bah) and one Sa'i (seven rounds between Safa and
				Marwah) for both the Hajj and 'Umrah. The case of such a
				person is very much similar to the pilgrim who performs
				ifrad (Hajj only).
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Jabir reported: "The Prophet (peace be upon him)
					combined Hajj and 'Umrah, with one tawaf." This
					is transmitted by Tirmidhi, who considers it a
					sound hadith.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet (peace be
					upon him) said: "He who declared his intention to
					perform Hajj and 'Umrah together, may perform one
					tawafand one Sa'i for them." This is reported by
					Tirmidhi, with the remarks that this is a hasan
					gharib hadith. Ad-Daraqutni has also reported it,
					but he adds: "One must not terminate one's state
					of ihram until one has completed both (the Hajj
					as well as 'Umrah)."
				</li>
				<li>
					The Prophet (peace be upon him) told 'Aishah:
					"Your tawaf of the Ka'bah and Sa'i between Safa
					and Marwah will suffice you for both Hajj and
					'Umrah." This is reported by Muslim.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah, however, is of the view that in such a case
				(i.e., combining Hajj and 'Umrah) lawaf and Sa'i must be
				performed twice. The first hadith is preferable
				considering its authenticity and strength of evidence.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the seven days of fasting, according to some
				scholars, one may fast them upon arriving at his home
				town. Others, like Mujahid and 'Ata, say one may do so
				after arriving at one's stopover. According to them one
				may fast these seven days on the way back home. These ten
				days of fasting do not necessarily have to be fasted
				consecutively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once a person makes intention (for Hajj or 'Umrah) and
				dons the ihram, he must make talbiyah.

		<section heading="TALBIYAH, Its Legality">
			<p>
				There is consensus among the scholars that talbiyah is a
				prescribed practice. Umm Salamah reported: "I heard
				Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) saying: "O Family
				of Muhammad! Whoso among you intends to perform Hajj must
				raise his voice while uttering talbiyah." This is
				reported by Ahmad and Ibn Hibban.
			</p>
			<p>
				The scholars disagree, however, on its legal status,
				timing, and the position of one who delays it.
				Ash-Shafi'i and Ahmad hold that it is sunnah of the
				Prophet (peace be upon him); it is desirable to utter it
				when putting on the garb of ihram. Thus, if a person
				intended to perform Hajj but did not utter talbiyah, his
				Hajj would still be valid, and he is not required to do
				anything, because according to them, such a person enters
				the state of ihram just by making intention to perform
				Hajj.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hanafi scholars hold that talbiyah or any substitute for
				it - such as containing praise or glorification of Allah.
				and bringing an animal for sacrifice -is a requisite
				condition for the validity of ihram. If someone puts on
				the garb of ihram without uttering talbiyah or glorifying
				Allah or bringing a sacrificial animal, his ihram is not
				valid, because ihram, according to them, is a combination
				of intention and one of the rites of Hajj. Thus, if one
				declares his intention for ihram and performs any of the
				rites of Hajj, for example if he glorifies Allah or
				declares, "There is no deity worthy of worship but Allah
				alone," or if he brought his sacrificial animal along
				with him but did not utter talbiyah, his ihram will be
				valid but he will be required to sacrifice an animal as a
				penalty for failing to do so.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to the well-known position of Imam Malik,
				uttering talbiyah is obligatory and in cases where one
				fails to do so or does not utter it upon donning the garb
				of ihram but utters it later on, one must slaughter an
				animal in atonement.

				Abu Bakr reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				was asked: "Which Hajj is the best Hajj?" He replied:
				"One in which voices are raised when saying talbiyah and

				when saying talbiyah.

			<p>
				Malik holds that one must not raise one's voice in saying
				talbiyah while inside a congregational mosque. One may,
				however, say it loud enough for oneself or for those
				around to hear it, except in the Sacred Mosque and the
				Mosque of Mina. In these two one should raise one's voice
				when saying talbiyah. This applies to male pilgrims only.

			<p>
				As for women, they may raise their voices when saying

			<p>
				A pilgrim should begin his talbiyah from the time he
				wears his ihram and continue it until throwing the first
				pebble at the Aqabah Jamarah on the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah,
				the Day of Nahr (sacrifice). Then he should stop saying
				talbiyah, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) did,
				according to a hadith transmitted by the Group.
				Ath-Thawri, the Hanafi school, Ash-Shafi'i, and the
				majority of scholars also hold this view. Ahmad and
				Ishaq, however, are of the view that a pilgrim must
				continue talbiyah until he has stoned all the three
				jamarahs. After that he may stop saying talbiyah. Malik
				holds that a pilgrim must continue talbiyah until the end
				of the Day of 'Arafah (the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah). This
				applies only to those performing Hajj.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for those performing 'Umrah, they may discontinue
				talbiyah after kissing the Black Stone and starting their
				tawaf. Ibn 'Abbas reports that the Prophet (peace be upon
				him) used to discontinue talbiyah after kissing the Black
				Stone (at the start of his tawaf). (Reported by Tirmidhi
				who considers it a sound hadith. When a person puts on
				ihram from a miqat he should discontinue ralbiyah on
				entering the Haram (Sacred Mosque). And those who put on
				ihram from Ju'rana or Tan'im, they should discontinue it
				on reaching the houses of Maklcah) In practice, most of
				the scholars follow this hadith.

				that bites people and frightens them and all other

				Ibn Taimiyyah further said: "If fleas and lice bite him,

				informed him that Ibn 'Abbas heard the Prophet (peace be
				upon him) saying, "He who finds no garb (for ihram), but
				has trousers, he may wear them, and he who finds no
				(suitable) slippers but has shoes, he may wear them." At
				this I (Aba Al-Sha'sha) asked him: "And did he say
				anything about cutting them?" Ibn 'Abbas said: "No."
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad, therefore, holds that a muhrim who finds no proper
				garb or slippers may wear his trousers and shoes, as
				shown by the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas, without being required
				to make any atonement for doing so. (Ibn Qayyim also
				prefers this view)
			</p>
			<p>
				The permission to wear one' s shoes in case of not having
				suitable slippers is, according to the majority of
				scholars, conditional on cutting the shoes down to the
				ankles, for this makes shoes similar to slippers. These
				scholars conclude this from the above mentioned hadith of
				Ibn 'Umar in which we read: "If he does not find slippers
				and finds shoes, he should cut them down to the ankles."
				The Hanafi scholars hold that he who has no garb for Hajj
				must unsew his trousers before using them as a garb. But
				he who wears them as they are (without unsewing them) he
				must make atonement for doing so.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malik and Ash-Shafi'i, however, are of the view that such
				a person may wear his trousers as they are, without
				incurring any penalty, as shown by a hadith of Jabir ibn
				Zayd from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				said: "If a person does not find the garb for ihram, he
				may wear trousers; if he does not find slippers, he may
				wear shoes after cutting them down to the ankles."
				(Reported by Nasa'i with a sound chain) Such a person
				must take off his trousers and put on a proper garb when
				and if he finds one. But if a person finds no proper
				upper Hajj garment, he should not wear his shirt, for
				unlike trousers one can do without it.

				Such a marriage contract is invalid, null and void, and

				Muslim and others. It is reported that 'Uthman ibn 'Affan
				said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "A muhrim

				thus contracted as invalid. Tirmidhi has also reported it
				but without the words "nor get engaged for marriage."
				Tirmidhi considers this a sound hadith and remarks that
				the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				practiced it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of the reports that say the Prophet (peace be upon

				contrary to the report transmitted by Muslim that "he

				ihram."
			</p>
			<p>
				Tirmidhi said: "There is disagreement concerning the

				marriage became known while he was in the state of ihram.
				Later he consummated his marriage with her in Saraf, on
				the road to Makkah, after he was free from the
				restrictions of ihram.'
			</p>
			<p>
				Hanafi scholars, however, hold that a muhrim may contract
				a marriage, because in the state of ihram what is
				forbidden is not marriage with a woman, but only the
				consummation of marriage. Contracting a marriage is
				permissible, but intercourse is forbidden.

				The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Wash away the

				The body of a deceased muhrim should neither be perfumed

				Concerning a muhrim dying in the state of ihram, the

				A muhrim is forbidden to partake of any land game

				The Prophet (peace be upon him) dispatched a group,
				including Abu Qatadah, and told them: "Follow the
				seashore until we meet again." All of them except Abu
				Qatadah were in the state of ihram. On the way, they saw
				a herd of zebras. Abu Qatadah attacked them and killed a
				female zebra. They all ate of its meat but said: "Is it
				permissible for us to partake of this land game in the
				state of ihram?" Then they carried the rest of the meat
				to the Prophet (peace be upon him), and told him the
				whole story. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to
				them: "Did any one of you ask Abu Qatadah to attack the
				herd, or point it out to him?" They said: "No." He said,
				"Then, you may eat what is left of the quarry." This is
				reported by Bukhari and Muslim.
			</p>
			<p>
				A muhrim may eat the meat of a game which is neither
				killed by him, nor for him, nor pointed out by him to
				someone else, and in the hunting of which he did not help
				others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Muttalib reported from Jabir that Allah's Messenger
				(peace be upon him) said: "The (eating of) land game is
				lawful for you in the state of ihram provided you
				yourselves do not kill it but it is killed for you (by
				someone else)." This is reported by Ahmad and Tirmidhi,
				who said: "Jabir's hadith is explanatory, but we do not
				know the narrator who reported it from Jabir to
				Al-Muttalib."
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of the schol;lrs follow this principle and consider
				that eating meat of land game is lawful for a muhrim if
				he does not hunt it, nor is it hunted for his sake.
				Ahmad, lshaq, Malik and the majority of scholars hold a
				similar view. Ash-Shafi'i said: "This is the best and the
				most correct hadith reported on this issue."
			</p>
			<p>
				The eating of a land game hunted by a muhrim or for a
				muhrim is unlawful for him, whether it is done with or
				without his permission. But, if someone else who is not
				in the state of ihram, hunted it for himself, and offered
				or sold some of it to a muhrim, he is permitted to
				partake of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abdur-Rahman bin 'Uthman At-Taimi reported: "We went for
				Hajj with Talhah bin Obaidullah. While we were in the
				state of ihram, some meat of birds was given to Talhah.
				He was asleep. Some of us ate of this meat, while others
				refrained. When Talhah woke up (and was told about this)
				he approved of those who had eaten it and said: "We used
				to eat such meat while we were with Allah's Messenger
				(peace be upon him). (Reported by Muslim and Ahmad) Other
				ahadith forbid a muhrim eating the meat of a land game,
				such as the one reported from As-Sa'ab bin Jathamah
				al-Laithee which says: "Someone presented meat of a zebra
				to the Prophet (peace be upon him), while he was in the
				area known as Al-Abwa or Bawaddan. The Prophet (peace be

				on the presenter's face, the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				said to him: "We declined (your) present only because we
				are in the state of ihram."
			</p>
			<p>
				Considering the assumption behind declining the
				meat--that it was hunted for the sake of those who were
				in the state of ihram--these ahadith can be reconciled.
				The people who were not in the state of ihram meant to
				hunt for those who were in the state of ihram. Ibn Abdul

				A muhrim who for a genuine reason is compelled to violate
				any of the restrictions of ihram, like shaving his head,
				wearing sewn clothes because of cold or heat or something
				else, with the exception of having sexual intercourse
				with his spouse, (For details on this see the following
				pages) he may do so, but he will have to slaughter a
				sheep, or feed six needy people, (Each needy person
				should be given at least the equivalent of half sa in
				measure) or fast three days to atone for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Violation of restrictions of ihram other than sexual
				intercourse does not invalidate Hajj or 'Umrah. Sexual
				intercourse with one's wife invalidates Hajj or 'Umrah.
				Abdur Rahman bin Abi Laila reported from K'ab bin 'Ujrah
				that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) passed by him
				while in Hudaibiyah and said, "Are the lice in your head
				bothering you?" He said, "Yes." The Prophet (peace be
				upon him) said, "Shave your head and slaughter a sheep,
				or fast three days or give a measure of three sa ' of
				dates to six needy people." (Reported by Bukhari, Muslim
				and Abu Daw'ud) In another report the same narrator says:
				"Lice infested my hair and bothered me, while I was with
				Allah ' s Messenger (peace be upon him) during
				Hudaibiyah. It got so bad that I was afraid of losing my
				sight. Then Allah, the Almighty revealed the Qur'anic
				verse (2.196) "And if any of you is ill or has an ailment
				in his scalp (necessitating shaving) (he should) in
				compensation either fast or feed the poor or otfer
				sacrifice." Upon this Allah's Messenger (peace be upon
				him) called me and said: "Shave your head, or fast three
				days or feed six poor persons one farq	(A measure
				commonly used in Madinah at the time of the Prophet, it
				is roughly equivalent to sixteen Iraqi rotl) of raisins,
				or slaughter a sheep." So I shaved my head and
				slaughtered a sheep."
			</p>
			<p>
				With regard to penalty Ash-Shafi'i makes no distinction
				between a muhrim who is compelled to violate ihram by
				some genuine need, and one who does so without any
				genuine cause. In either case penalty must be paid to
				atone tor violation. Abu Hanifah holds that a person who
				violates the ihram restrictions without genuine cause
				must offer a sheep to compensate for his violation, if he
				can afford it. A person who cannot afford this does not

			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Al-'Abbas At-Tabari said: "If a muhrim had sexual

				from ihram, regardless of whether it was before or after
				'Arafah, it will invalidate his Hajj. Such a person,
				however, must continue performing the rest of his Hajj
				rites. He must slaughter a camel and make up for his Hajj
				the following year."
			</p>
			<p>
				If the wife was in the state of ihram and she accepted
				what her husband did, she must continue the performance
				of Hajj, but must also make it up the following year, and
				besides, according to the majority of the scholars, must
				also offer a sacrifice. According to 'Ata some scholars
				hold that the husband and wife may offer only one
				sacrifice.
			</p>
			<p>
				In his commentary on hadith, Sharh Al-Sunnah, Al-Baghawi
				said - and this is the more famous of the two sayings of
				Ash-Shafi'i - that a man is required to pay the penalty
				for sexual intercourse on a day in Ramadan. Such a couple
				should keep apart (Doing so is mandatory according to
				Ahmad and Malik, but the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools take
				it as a recommendation) when they go to make the next
				Hajj (in compensation for the first one) lest they should
				repeat what they did before.
			</p>
			<p>
				If such a man is unable to slaughter a camel, then he may
				slaughter a cow. If he cannot afford it, then he may
				slaughter seven (7) sheep. And if he is even unable to do
				that, then he may estimate the value of the camel, and
				distribute food of that amount among the poor and needy
				people, so that every person receives one mudd. If he is
				unable to do so, then he should fast a day for each mudd
				thereof.
			</p>
			<p>
				The scholars said: If a muhrim had sexual intercourse
				with his spouse before the Day of 'Arafah, then his Hajj
				will be null and void, and he will have to offer in
				sacrifice a sheep or one-seventh of a she camel. But if
				he did so after the Day of 'Arafah, his Hajj will not be
				invalidated, but he will have to slaughter a camel.
			</p>
			<p>
				In case such an act is committed by a qarin pilgrim - one
				combining Hajj with 'Umrah - he must make up for this
				Hajj qarin with another Hajj qarin and offer another
				sacrifice just as the pilgrim performing Hajj only does.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sexual intercourse, if it happens after the first break
				in ihram (following throwing pebbles and shaving one's
				head at Mina), does not invalidate Hajj nor does it
				require Hajj to be repeated later. This is the view of
				most of the knowledgeable people. But others hold that
				making up Hajj and offering a sacrifice is mandatory.
				This is the opinion of Ibn 'Umar, Al-Hasan, and Ibrahim.
				There is also disagreement as to what animal is to be

			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas, 'Ikrimah, and 'Ata are of the view that it
				must be a camel; this is also one of the opinions of

				agrees with this second opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
				A muhrim, who had a wet dream or ejaculated by thinking

			<p>
				These scholars, however, hold that if one kisses or

				Allah says: "O You Who Believe, kill not game while in
				the Sacred Precincts or in Pilgrim garb. If any of you
				doeth so intentionally, the compensation is an offering,
				brought to the Ka'bah, of a domestic animal equivalent to
				the one he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you;
				or by way of atonement, the feeding of the indigent; or
				its equivalent in fasts; that he may taste of the penalty
				of his deed. Allah forgives what is past: For repetition,
				Allah will exact from him the penalty. For Allah is
				Exalted, and Lord of Retribution." (Qur'an 5.95)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Kathir said: "The majority holds that as far as the
				penalty is concerned there is no difference between one
				who deliberately kills a game and he who does so
				forgetfully." Az-Zuhri said: "The Qur'an imposed a
				penalty only on the intentional killer of the game, while
				the sunnah includes those who kill a game forgetfully."
				In other words the Qur'an imposes a penalty on an
				intentional killer for his sin, as is indicated by the
				words of Allah "...that he may taste the penalty of his
				deed."
			</p>
			<p>
				The sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the
				judgments of his Companions show that he who kills a game
				by mistake must also pay a penalty. Killing a game is a
				destructive act, and therefore, whether it is inflicted
				intentionally or forgetfully, makes little difference,
				though a deliberate killer is guilty of a sin, whereas
				one who does so by mistake commits no sin.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Al-Musawwa, it is stated: "In the opinion of Abu
				Hanifah, the verse: 'If any of you doeth so
				intentionally, the compensation is an offering, brought
				to the Ka'bah, of a domestic animal equivalent to the one
				he killed' means that one who kills a game must
				compensate it by sacrificing something similar to or
				equivalent in price to be decided by two just men." It
				may be a domestic animal that is brought to the Ka'bah
				for sacrifice, or else one may feed the needy.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Ash-Shafi'i's opinion it means that, "Anyone who kills
				a game while in the Hajj garb must pay a penalty for his
				act by sacrificing an animal similar in shape and form
				and two just men must make sure that it is equivalent in
				value to the game killed. Or else, one must make an

				Abdul Malik bin Qurair reported from Mohammad bin Sirin
				that a man came to 'Umar bin Al-Khattab and said: "A
				friend of mine and I ran after a wild game while we were
				in pilgrim garb. We killed a deer. What is our
				atonement?" 'Umar told a man next to him: "Come, you and
				I must judge together." Then he gave his verdict and told
				the man to sacrifice a goat in compensation." The man
				left saying, "This is the Chief of the Faithful, who
				cannot pass a judgment concerning the killing of a deer!"
				'Umar heard the man's remark, and he called him back and
				asked him: "Have you read Surah Al-Ma'idah (of the
				Qur'an)?" The man said: "No." 'Umar asked further: "Do
				you know this man who participated in the judgment with
				me?" The man said, "No." 'Umar said: 'Had you told me
				that you have read Surah Al-Ma'idah, I would have made
				you ache from beating." Then he added: "Allah, the
				Exalted One, says in His Book: 'If any of you doeth so
				intentionally, the compensation is an offering, brought
				to the Ka'bah, of a domestic animal equivalent to the one
				he killed, as adjudged by two just men among you.' And
				this man (who judged with me) is Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf'."
			</p>
			<p>
				Earlier generations of Muslim scholars gave verdicts that
				a camel is to be sacrificed for an ostrich, and a cow for
				a zebra, a stag or a deer, and similarly a sheep for a
				woodchuck, a pigeon, a turtledove, a mountain quail, and
				certain other birds. A male sheep is to be sacrificed for
				a hyena, a goat for a deer, a four month old goat for a
				rabbit, a baby goat (kid) for a fox, and a four month old
				goat should be sacrificed for killing a jerboa.

				Sa'id bin Mansur reported that commenting on the words of
				Allah "the compensation is an offering, brought to the
				Ka'bah, of a domestic animal" Ibn 'Abbas said: "If a
				muhrim kills an animal, an assessment should be made and
				then he should make compensation. If he has an animal of
				an equivalent value for the game, he must slaughter it
				and give its meat in charity, but if he does not have an
				animal of an equivalent value, he should assess the value
				of the game and then give away food for that amount. In
				case one does not have money for it, then, one must fast
				one day for each half sa' of food. If a muhrim killed a
				game, he must slaughter a similar animal according to the
				judgment of two just men. If one killed a deer or similar
				animal, one must slaughter a sheep in Makkah. If one
				cannot buy a sheep, then, one must feed six poor people,
				and if one cannot afford that, then one must fast three
				days.
			</p>
			<p>
				If one killed a male adult deer or similar animal, he
				must slaughter a cow, otherwise one must feed twenty
				needy people, or fast for twenty days. If an ostrich or
				zebra or similar animal is killed, one must fast thirty
				days. This is reported by Ibn Abi Hatem and Ibn Jarir.
				They also added to this the words: "The food given to the
				needy must be sufficient to satisfy their hunger."

		<section heading="Killing a Game Within the Sacred Precincts and Cutting Trees">
			<p>
				It is forbidden for both a muhrim and a non-muhrim to
				kill the game in the sacred precincts of Haram, or to
				frighten it, or to cut its trees that are not planted by
				the people, or to cut tender plants, including thorns,
				except for the plants called Idhkher and Sana which may
				be cut, pulled or weeded out.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Abbas reported that on the day of the conquest of
				Makkah the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Verily,
				this is a Sacred City, its thorns and its plants must not
				be cut, its wild game must not be frightened, and none is
				allowed to pick up lost articles unless one knows its
				owner (in order to return it to him)."' 'Abbas added,
				"Except (for the plant) Idhkher" which is used by
				blacksmiths and burned in households." The Prophet (peace
				be upon him) excluded this plant, saying, "Except
				idhkher." (Bukhari)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shawkani said: "Qurtubi said: 'Jurists hold that the
				trees forbidden to be cut are the wild trees or plants
				that are not planted or grown by people. As to the trees
				grown by men there is disagreement among scholars. The
				majority holds it permissible to cut trees grown by men.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shafi'i said: -Cutting any tree or plant is
				punishable.+ Ibn Qudamah also holds this view. There is
				also disagreement on punishment for cutting the first
				kind of trees.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malik holds there is no penalty for it, although one who
				does this commits a sin. 'Ata opined: "Such a person
				should seek Allah's forgiveness." Abu Hanifah is of the
				opinion that such a person must compensate for it by
				sacrificing an animal equivalent in value to the damage
				caused by him. Ash-Shafi'i said: "For cutting a big tree
				one must slaughter a cow in compensation, and for a
				smaller tree a sheep."
			</p>
			<p>
				The scholars, however, make an exception in making use of
				broken branches, fallen trees, or leaves. It is
				permissible to use these. Ibn Qudamah said: "There is
				agreement on the permissibility of using herbs, flowers,
				grass and tender plants grown by men within the sacred
				precincts of Haram."
			</p>
			<p>
				The author of Al Rawdah al-Nadiyyah says: "The dwellers
				of the Haram, who are not in the state of ihram, incur
				sin, but no penalty for killing a game or cutting a tree
				within the Sacred Precincts." As for those who are in the
				state of ihram, they must pay the penalty prescribed by
				Allah for killing a game. But for cutting a tree in
				Makkah they incur no penalty, because the evidence in
				this regard is not strong enough. The hadith which states
				"If one cuts a big tree, he must slaughter a cow in
				compensation" is not a sound hadith. What is related from
				earlier scholars and their opinions on this issue, cannot
				be taken as conclusive by themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				The author continues: "In short, there is no connection
				between prohibition of killing game and cutting trees,
				and the obligation of paying a penalty or giving away an
				amount of equivalent value in atonement. Prohibition,
				however, is clear from what is forbidden. The penalty or
				equivalent value can be applied only when there is clear
				evidence to establish it. But the only evidence we have
				in this matter is the words of Allah "...Kill no game
				while in the Sacred Precincts or in pilgrim garb..." In
				this verse only penalty is mentioned; nothing else is
				essential (wajib).

		<section heading="Sacred Precincts of Madinah (Haram Madinah)">
			<p>
				In the Sacred Precincts of Madinah killing a game and
				cutting its trees is prohibited as it is in the case of
				Haram Makkah. Jabir bin Abdullah reported that Allah's
				Messenger (peace be upon him) said: "Ibrahim (peace be
				upon him) made Makkah Haram (sacred), and I declare
				Madinah and what lies between its two black tracts Haram.
				No game (within this area) is to be killed, nor any adah
				- a thorny plant - growing therein is to be cut."
				(Muslim)
			</p>
			<p>
				Ali reported that concerning Madinah the Prophet (peace
				be upon him) said: "Its plants must not be cut, its game
				must not be frightened, articles lost in it must not be
				picked up except by someone making announcement to find
				the owner, nor is any man to bear arms for fighting in
				it. Its trees must not be cut, except when (required for)
				feeding one's camels." (Reported by Ahmad and Ahu Daw+ud)
				Both Bukhari and Muslim report that the Prophet (peace be
				upon him) said, "Madinah is Haram (Sacred) and its Sacred
				Precincts extend from 'Eer to Thowr." (Eer is a mountain
				at the miqat for Madinah, and Thowr is a mountain near
				Uhud on the north) Another agreed upon hadith reported
				from Abu Hurairah says, "The Prophet (peace be upon him)
				declared the area between the two black tracts of Madinah
				as sacred and then extended it to about twelve miles
				around Madinah." The Prophet (peace be upon him)
				permitted the residents of Madinah to cut trees for
				making plows, carts and other necessary tools and
				equipment. He also permitted them to cut its grass to
				feed their animals. Ahmad reported from Jabir bin
				Abdullah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "The
				area between two black tracts of Madinah is a Haram (a
				sanctuary). No tree must be cut (within this area) except
				for use as fodder for animals."
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike this the residents of Makkah, who have sufficient
				supply for their animal feed, are not permitted to cut
				even the grass to feed their animals. The residents of
				Madinah are not self-sufficient and are therefore allowed
				to use trees and grass for their animals.
			</p>
			<p>
				But killing the game or cutting off the trees in the
				sanctuary of Madinah carries no penalty nor requires any
				compensation, although doing so is a sinful act.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anas reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said,
				"Madinah is a sanctuary from such and such a place to
				such and such a place, and (within this area) its trees
				shall not be cut, nor any (unlawful) act committed, and
				whoso does so on him shall rest the curse of Allah, His
				angels and the entire mankind." (Bukhari)
			</p>
			<p>
				It is permissible to pick up and use branches of a fallen
				tree within this sanctuary. Sa'ad bin Abi Waqqas reported
				that while on his way to his palace at 'Aqiq he found a
				slave cutting off a tree or hitting and shaking it for
				leaves. Sa'ad seized whatever the slave had gathered. The
				owners of the slave went to Sa'ad and asked him to return
				to them what he had seized from the slave. Sa'ad said,
				"Allah forbid that I should return something which
				Allah's Messenger has given me as a gift." And saying
				this he refused to return it to them. (Muslim)
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "If you find anyone
				hunting a wild game within the sacred bounds of Madinah
				you may seize it from him." (Abu Daw+ud, and Al-Hakim,
				who considers it a sound hadith) This is reported by Abu
				Daw'ud, and Al-Hakim, who considers it a sound hadith.

				One may enter Makkah without putting on a garb of ihram
				if one does not intend to make Hajj or 'Umrah. One may be
				a frequent visitor to Makkah as a wood-cutter, a grass
				cutter, a water carrier, or a hunter, etc., or not a

				Regardless of whether one enters it in a state of

				his companions.

			<p>
				Muslim reported that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon

			<p>
				Wearing ihram is not compulsory for those who pass these

			<p>
				It is desirable for those intending to visit Makkah to do
				the following: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					To take a bath. It is reported that Ibn 'Umar
					used to take a bath before entering Makkah.
				</li>
				<li>
					To spend the night at Dhi Tuwa, a valley in the
					direction of Al-Zaher. The Prophet (peace be upon
					him) used to spend the night there. Nafi' said:
					"Ibn 'Umar used to do the same.'' (Reported by
					Bukhari and Muslim)
				</li>
				<li>
					To enter Makkah from the upper hill called
					"Koda". The Prophet (peace be upon him) entered
					Makkah from the direction of Al-Mu'allah. Whoever
					is able to follow this path, should do so, but
					one commits no sin if one does not do it.
				</li>
				<li>
					To hurry to the Sacred Mosque as soon as one
					deposits one's belongings in a safe place. One
					must enter the Sacred Mosque from the gate known
					as Bab Bani Shayba - Bab us-Salam - and say
					humbly and sincerely: "A'udhu billahil azeem wa
					biwajihil kareem wa sultanihil qadeem , minash
					shaltanir rajeem. Bismillah allahumma salli 'ala
					muhammadin wa alihi wa salam, Allahumma ghifirli
					zunubi waftah li abwaba rahmatika (I seek refuge
					with Allah the Supreme, I seek refuge with His
					Honor and Eternal Glory, with His Everlasting
					Authority, from the cursed devil. O Allah, Bless
					Muhammad and the family of Muhammad! O Allah!
					Forgive my sins and open Your doors of mercy for
					me)."
				</li>
				<li>
					To raise one's hands on first sight of the Ka'bah
					and say: "Allahumma zid hadhal bayti tashrifan wa
					ta 'zeeman wa takriman wa muhabatan wa zid min
					sharfihi wa karamihi mimman hajjahu au 'itamarahu
					tashrifan wa takriman wa ta'zeeman wa birran (O

					righteousness.)" And say, "Allahumma antas salam,
					wa minkas salam, fahayyina rabbana bis-salam (O
					Allah! You are the Peace, from You is the Peace.
					O Allah! Greet us with the Peace)."
				</li>
				<li>
					Then head to the Black Stone and kiss it quietly.
					If kissing is not possible, then one may touch it
					with a hand and kiss the hand, and if even this
					is not possible then one may just point to it
					with a hand.
				</li>
				<li>
					Then begin tawaf (circumambulation) starting from
					the Black Stone.
				</li>
				<li>
					One does not have to perform salutation prayer to
					the Sacred Mosque. because tawafof Ka'bah is its
					salutation. If, however, it is time for the
					prescribed daily prayers, then one must offer
					them with the congregation. The Prophet (peace be

					Upon reaching the Yemeni corner the Prophet
					(peace be upon him) said: "Rabbana aatina fid
					dunniyya hasanatan wa fil akhirati hasanatan wa

					Ash-Shafi'i said: "I like that each time on

					and say: Allahumma ij 'alhu hajjan mabruran wa
					dhanban maghfuran wa Sa'iyan mashkuran (O Allah!
					Let this be an accepted Hajj, with sins forgiven,
					and a well appreciated effort)." And during each
					round of tawaf he would say: "Rabbighfir warham

				This tawaf is called Tawafal Qudum (Arrival
				Circumambulation), if a pilgrim is performing a mufrid
				(single) Hajj. Otherwise it is called Tawaf al Tahayya
				(Circumambulation of Greeting), or Tawafad Dakhul
				(Circumambulation of Entry). It is neither an essential
				condition nor an obligation. For a pilgrim performing
				Hajj Tamattu' (combining Hajj and 'Umrah with a break),
				or performing Hajj Qiran (combining Hajj and 'Umrah
				without a break), it is Tawafal 'Umrah ('Umrah
				Circumambulation), and after having performed it a
				pilgrim does not need to perform a Tawafal Tahaya or
				Tawafal Qudum. Such a pilgrim must, however, complete his
				'Umrah making a Sa'i (seven rounds of walking) between
				the hills of Safa and Marwah.

				The Hanafi school holds that cleanliness from impurities
				is not a necessary condition, but an obligation which, if
				not found, may be compensated by a sacrifice. Thus if
				somone performs a Tawaf in a state of minor impurity his
				tawaf will be valid, but he will have to offer a sheep in
				sacrifice. If such a person is junub or ha+id his or her
				tawaf will still be valid, but he or she will have to
				sacrifice a camel as a penalty and repeat the tawaf as
				long as he or she is in Makkah. As to the cleanliness of
				clothes or body, the Hanafi school takes it as a sunnah
				only.

				Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				said: "Tawaf is (similar to) a prayer ... but Allah, the
				Almighty, has made talking for one (engaged in tawaf)

				should say only good things. (Tirmidhi and Ad-Daraqutni.

				'Aishah reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				entered her apartment and tound her crying. He asked her,
				"Has your monthly course set in?" That is, are you
				weeping because you are menstruating? She replied, "Yes."
				Upon this the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "This is
				a matter inscribed by Allah, the Almighty, for all
				daughters of Adam. You should perform all the rites of
				Hajj, except tawaf (circumambulation) - which you should
				perform after taking a complete bath (when you are
				clean)." (Reported by Muslim) 'Aishah also said: "The

				upon arriving in Makkah was to perform Wudu and then make
				a tawaf of Ka'bah." (Bukhari and Muslim)
			</p>
			<p>
				There is consensus that if one suffers from an illness
				that causes one to be continuously impure physically,
				such as leaking urine or continuous bleeding in the case
				of a menstruating woman, one may perform tawaf without
				incurring any penalty or need for making compensation.
				Malik related that a woman came to Abdullah bin Umar
				seeking a verdict. She said, "I came to the Sacred Mosque
				to pertorm tawaf, but when I arrived at the door of the
				Mosque I started bleeding. So I went away and waited
				until I became clean, and then returned to the Sacred

				when I arrived at the door of the Mosque I started
				bleeding again. (What should I do?)" Ibn 'Umar said,
				"That bleeding is a spurt trom the devil. You should take

					tahlil (La ilaha illahlah), and raising one's

					then kiss it, or if even that is not possible,
					one may just point to it with a stick, etc. as is
					mentioned in some of the ahadith given below.

			</ol>
			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar said: "Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)
				faced the Black Stone, touched it, and then placed his

				a long time. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'O

				(Reported by Al-Hakim, who considers it a sound hadith
				with a sound chain of authorities)
			</p>

				It is reported by Ibn 'Abbas that 'Umar bent down towards
				the Black Stone and said: "By Allah! I know that you are
				a mere stone, and if I had not seen my beloved Prophet
				(peace be upon him) kissing you and touching you I would
				have never done so." The Qur'an says: "You have indeed in
				the Messenger of Allah a beautiful pattern (of
				conduct)."' (Qur'an 33.32) This was reported by Ahmad and

				Nafi' said, "I have seen Ibn 'Umar touching the Black

				by Bukhari and Muslim)

			<p>
				Sowayd bin Ghaflah said: "I have seen 'Umar kissing the
				Black Stone and touching it." He further said: "I know
				that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was especially very
				particular about it.'' (Muslim) Ibn 'Umar reported that
				Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) used to come to

				Such information devolves obligation on all those whom it
				reaches, even if they may not fully comprehend its
				significance. It is known, however, that kissing the
				Black Stone signifies respect for it, recognition of our
				obligation toward it, and using it as a means of seeking
				Allah's blessings. Indeed Allah has preferred some stones
				over others, as He preferred some countries and cities,
				days and nights, and months over others. The underlying
				spirit of all this is unquestioning submission to Allah.
			</p>
			<p>
				In some ahadith which say that "the Black Stone is
				Allah's right hand on earth," we do find, however, a
				plausible rationale and justification for this statement.
				In other words whosoever touches the Black Stone he
				pledges allegiance to Allah, as it were, by giving his
				hand into the hand of Allah, just as some followers do
				pledge their fealty to their kings and masters, by
				kissing and shaking hands with them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Muhallib said: "The hadith of 'Umar refutes the
				assertions of those who say that 'The Black Stone is
				Allah's right hand on earth wherewith He shakes the hands
				of His slaves."' God forbid that we should ascribe any
				physical organs to Allah. The commandment to kiss the
				Black Stone is meant to test and to demonstrate palpably
				as to who obeys and submits. It may be compared with the
				command to Iblis to bow to Adam.

			<p>
				We have no definite evidence, however, to believe that
				any of the stones used in building the Ka'bah originally

				(uncovering one's right shoulder) are prescribed for men
				only while making tawaffor 'Umrah. In case of a pilgrim

				(walking between Safa and Marwah) . Shafi'i school holds
				that a pilgrim, who does make idtiba' (i.e., uncovers his
				right shoulder) and performs ramal (i.e., jogs), while
				making Tawaf al Qudum on arrival and then making Sa'i
				between Safa and Marwah, is not required to repeat

				What is the wisdom behind ramal? It is reported by Ibn

				companions came to Makkah, they were weakened by the
				fever in Yathrib. Thereupon the idolators said, ''A
				people weakened with fever have come to you and they are
				aMicted with evil." Allah. the Almighty, informed His
				Prophet (peace be upon him) about their saying. So he
				commanded them to jog through the first three rounds of
				tawaf around the Ka'bah, and to walk between its two
				corners. When the idolaters saw the Muslims jogging, they
				said: "Are those the people you said are weak because of
				the fever? They are stronger and sturdier than us!" Ibn
				'Abbas added: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not
				command them to jog all through the seven rounds in order
				not to overexert themselves." This was reported by
				Bukhari, Muslim, and Abu Daw'ud, whose wording is given
				here.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Umar was of the opinion that jogging be stopped as there
				was no longer any need for it after the Muslims had

				leave it (in its original form) so that the future

				'Aishah used to perform tawaf keeping apart from men and

		<section heading="Its Legal Status">
			<p>
				There is disagreement among scholars concerning the legal
				status of Sa'i between Safa and Marwah. These scholars
				may be divided into three groups:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					'Aishah, and from among the Companions Ibn 'Umar,
					and Jabir hold that Sa'i of Safa and Marwah is an
					essential part of Hajj rites. Malik, AshShafi'i,
					and Ahmad (according to one narration from him)
					also hold a similar opinion. Thus if a pilgrim
					fails to perform Sa 'i his Hajj will be void and
					his offering of a sacrifice will not be enough to
					make up for it. These scholars based their
					opinion on the following:
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				a) Az-Zuhari reported from 'Urwah that he said: "I asked
				'Aishah about it and recited to her the verse "Behold !
				Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So if
				those who visit the House in the season or at other
				times, compass round them, there is no sin in them."
				(Qur'an 2.158) Then I said to her, "By Allah, I see that
				(in light of this verse) there is no sin on a person who
				does not perform Sa'i between them!" 'Aishah said to me,
				"O my nephew! That is the worst interpretation you have
				put on this verse. It does not mean what you say. If it
				had meant what you say it means, then the wording should
				have been 'should not compass them round.' This verse was
				revealed concerning the Ansar, who used to worship the
				idol Manat in an area called Al-Mushallal. They feared
				they were committing a sin by walking between Safa and
				Marwah.|"After they embraced Islam they asked the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) about it. At this Allah revealed this
				verse. The Prophet (peace be upon him) has by his
				practice affirmed authenticity of the Sa'i between these
				two hills, and no one has the authority to abandon it.
				(Bukhari)
			</p>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					These scholars, in support of their standpoint,
					refer to the Qur' anic verse 2:158, which states
					there is no sin if a person neglects it. In other
					words it is not obligatory. That it is only
					sunnah is also obvious from the fact that Safa
					and Marwah are described as "the symbols of
					Allah."
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				It is reported that the Mushaf of Ubaiy and Ibn Mas'ud
				read " ..if those who visit the House in the season or at
				other times, should not compass them, it is no sin in
				them." This is not the Qur'anic text, but it does convey
				an important piece of information and an interpretation
				of the Qur'anic text.
			</p>
			<p>
				The author of Al-Mughni prefers this opinion, and says:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					This is preferable, because the argument of those
					holding it to be wajib supports the absoluteness
					of the obligation rather than the principle that
					anything needed to fulfill an obligation (wajib)
					is also obligatory (wajib).
				</li>
				<li>
					'Aishah's statement in this respect is different
					from what other Companions of the Prophet (peace
					be upon him) have narrated.
				</li>
				<li>
					The hadith of the daughter of Abi Tajrah has
					among its narrators one called Abdullah bin
					Al-Mu'mal, who is controversial. According to him
					it is obligatory, whereas it is only wajib.
				</li>
				<li>
					The verse quoted above was revealed concerning
					those people who feared they would be committing
					a sin if they walked between Safa and Marwah as
					they used to do in the days of Jahiliyya while
					two idols were set on top of Safa and Marwah.

				Thus if a pilgrim stops Sa'i (between Safa and Marwah)

				by Sa'id bin Mansur) because the continuity in Sa'i is

				The author of Al-Mughni observes: "Ahmad says there is no

				Sa 'i may be performed either riding or walking, but

				performed Sa'i on foot, but when the overcrowding
				increased and he found that the people wanted to know
				more (about their religion), he rode his mount so that
				they could see him and ask him (whatever they wanted to
				ask).
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu At-Tufail asked Ibn 'Abbas, "Tell me about the Sa'i
				between Safa and Marwah - is it (really) sunnah to
				perform it riding, for your people claim it is?" Ibn
				'Abbas replied, "They are right, but they are wrong."
				Then he added, "The people crowded around the Prophet

				this is (Prophet) Muhammad. Even young girls came out of

				he mounted on his camel, because the people were not

			<p>
				The Malikites hold that a person who performs Sa'i

				It is well known that the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				went through the Safa gate, and on approaching Safa he
				recited the Qur'anic verse 2.158 "Verily, Safa and Marwah
				are among the symbols of Allah" and then saying "I begin
				with what Allah Himself began" he climbed Safa until he
				could see the Ka'bah from where he stood. He faced the
				Ka'bah, thrice proclaimed Allah's Oneness, glorified Him,
				praised Him, and then said, "There is no deity worthy of
				worship except Allah. He has no partners. To Him belongs
				the kingdom and all praise. He alone grants life and
				causes death, He has power over all things.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no God but He. He has fulfilled His promise,
				given victory to His servant, and He alone defeated the
				confederates." Thrice he made similar supplications. Then
				he walked toward Marwah and climbed it, until he could
				see the Ka'bah. There he made supplications as he had at
				Safa.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nafi' has reported that he saw Abdullah bin 'Umar
				standing on Safa and supplicating in these words: "O
				Allah! You have said 'Call Me and I shall respond to your
				call.' Verily, You do not break Your promise. O Allah! I
				pray that just as You guided me to Islam, so divest me
				not of it until the day you cause me to die."

				Making supplications, remembrance of Allah, and reciting
				the Qur'an while walking between Safa and Marwah are all
				desirable. It is reported while making Sa'i the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) used to supplicate, "O my Lord,
				forgive me, have mercy upon me, and guide me to the

				forgive me, and have mercy upon me. You are the most
				Honorable, most Dignified."

				After performing Tawaf and Sa'i a pilgrim completes the
				rites of 'Umrah. Similarly a person performing Hajj
				Tamattu' may terminate his state of ihram by clipping
				some of his hair short or else shave it all. However, a
				pilgrim should keep his state of ihram if he is
				performing Hajj Qiran. Such a pilgrim may terminate his
				state of ihram on the Day of Sacrifice (Yaum un-Nahr)
				after the sacrifice. For a qarin pilgrim, this Sa'i will
				suffice in place of the one other pilgrims are re4uired
				to make after Tawafal Fard when they return from Mina. As
				for those pilgrims who join Hajj with 'Umrah with a break
				in between (i.e., who make Hajj Tamattu'), they must
				perform another Sa'i and stay in Makkah until Yaum
				al-Tarwiya (the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah).

				It is sunnah to move to Mina on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah.

				performing Hajj Tamattu' should put on his ihram from the

				ihram from Makkah, otherwise he may assume ihram trom
				wherever he is staying. In a hadith we read, "He who is

				Staying at Arafah means physical and mental presence in

				sitting, lying down, walking, and regardless of whether
				one is in a state of purity or not, e.g., a menstruating

				Ash-Shafi'i, Ahmad, Al-Hasan, Abu Thawr, Ishaq, and Ibn

				After reporting the above hadith of Ibn Ya'mur, Tirmidhi

				It is reported in Subul as-Salaam: "A group of scholars
				hold that an old woman may travel without being
				accompanied by any mahram relative."
			</p>
			<p>
				This permission for a woman to travel without a mahram in
				the company of trusted companions or when the journey to
				Hajj is safe is supported by what is reported by Bukhari
				from 'Adi ibn Hatem, who says: "I was with the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) when a man came to him and complained
				of poverty. Another man complained about highway robbery.
				Thereupon the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'O 'Adi!
				Have you seen the city of Hira in Iraq?' I said: 'No, but
				I have heard about it.' The Prophet (peace be upon him)
				said: 'If you lived long enough you will see that a woman
				will travel from Hira and will perform Tawaf round
				Ka'bah, and she will have no fear except that of Allah."
			</p>
			<p>
				This opinion is supported by the fact that 'Umar gave
				permission to the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon
				him) to perform Hajj while accompanied by 'Uthman and
				Abdur-Rahman ibn 'Awf. 'Uthman would announce them to
				people telling them to avoid looking at them or coming
				close to their camels.
			</p>
			<p>
				If, however, a woman fails to abide by this provision and
				performs Hajj alone - without being accompanied by any
				mahram - her Hajj would still be valid.
			</p>
			<p>
				The author of Subul as-Salaam says that Ibn Taimiyyah
				said: "Hajj of a woman without a mahram is valid, and
				likewise of a person who is financially not able to
				perform it."
			</p>
			<p>
				In brief, those for whom Hajj is not compulsory due to
				sickness, poverty, fear of highway robbery, or in the
				case of a woman because no mahram is available to
				accompay her, if these people nonetheless perform Hajj,
				it will be credited to their account. Some of them try
				their best (and exert themselves to the utmost) like
				those performing Hajj on foot, while others are guilty of
				sins, such as those who beg others to help them perform
				Hajj, or a woman that performs Hajj without a mahram male
				companion. Notwithstanding their valid excuse, if any of
				these people perform Hajj, it will be quite valid, for
				their sin relates to their (choice of unlawful) means and
				has no bearing on the objective as such.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is reported in Al-Mughni: "If a person, not obliged to
				perform Hajj because he is unable (financially) to do so,
				should seek to perform Hajj, suffering hardship,
				traveling on foot and without necessary provisions, his
				Hajj will be quite valid and acceptable."

				Upon arriving in Muzdalifah the Prophet (peace be upon
				him) offered Maghrib and two rak'ahs for 'Isha (making
				qasr). He ordered one single call for both 'Isha and
				Maghrib, but a separate iqamah for each. No other
				supererogatory prayer is to be olfered in between these
				two prayers. In the hadith recorded by Muslim we read
				that the Prophet (peace be upon him) arrived in
				Muzdalifah, and combined the Maghrib and 'Isha prayers,
				with one adhan and two iqamah.s. He did not offer any
				other prayer in between the two. Combining these prayers
				is, according to the consensus of the scholars, a sunnah,
				though there is disagreement as to those who offer these
				two prayers separately in their times. Most of the
				scholars consider it permissible, but hold that following
				the example of the Prophet is far more preferable. Thawri
				and other knowledgeable people are of the opinion that a

				Muzdalifah must re-do it. They are of the opinion,

				Jabir says: "When the Prophet (peace be upon him) reached
				Muzdalifah, he offered both Maghrib and 'Isha prayers,
				then he lay down to sleep. He slept until dawn, then he
				got up and offered Fajr prayer, and mounted his she
				camel, Al-Qaswa. When he reached Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram he
				stopped there until there was light all around, then
				before sunrise, he left the place. There is no evidence
				to show that the Prophet (peace be upon him) spent the
				night (at Muzdalifah) in prayers and supplications. This
				is the correct position about spending the night at
				Muzdalifah and stopping there in the light of the
				practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him).
			</p>
			<p>
				Ahmad holds that spending the night at Muzdalifah is
				obligatory for all pilgrims except shepherds and water
				providers for whom it is not obligatory to do so. All the
				imams of schools of Islamic law consider stopping and
				spending some time at Muzdalifah obligatory. They do not,
				however, regard spending the entire night there as
				obligatory. Spending some time there, means being present
				physically, in any posture or condition, standing,
				sitting, being awake or asleep, walking. or passing by.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hanafi school is of the opinion that it is obligatory
				to be present at Muzdalifah before the dawn of Yaum
				al-Nahr (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah). So, if one fails to do
				so without a genuine excuse, one must offer a sacrifice
				unless one has a genuine excuse in which case one is not
				obligated to be physically present, nor does one incur
				any penalty.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Maliki school holds that stopping at Muzdalifah,
				before dawn, and spending some time there is enough,
				while going from Arafah to Mina, is obligatory when one
				has no excuse to do otherwise. For a pilgrim with a
				genuine excuse stopping and staying at Muzdalifah is not
				obligatory.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Shafi'i school holds that only the physical presence
				in the second half of the night of the 10th of
				Dhul-Hijjah at Muzdalifah, after spending the day at
				Arafah, is obligatory. One is not required to spend the
				entire night there, nor is it essential even to make sure
				whether the place one is staying is within the boundaries
				of Muzdalifah.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is the sunnah, however, to offer Fajr prayer at its
				early time, then head for and stop at Al-Mash'ar al-Haram
				till daylight spreads before the sunrise. One should
				spend this time in supplication and remembrance of Allah.
				Allah says in the Qur'an (2.198): "Then when you pour
				down from (mount) Arafah, celebrate the praises of Allah
				at the Sacred Monument and celebrate His praises as He
				has directed you, even though, before this, you went
				astray. Then pass on at a quick pace from the place
				whence it is usual for the multitude to do so, and ask
				for Allah's forgiveness. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most
				Merciful."

				Before sunrise, the pilgrims leave Muzdalifah tor Mina,

			<p>
				These rites begin with throwing the pebbles, followed by

			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Hanifah is of the opinion that if someone failed to

				In his Al-Ahya, Al-Ghazali says: "As to the throwing of

				"Theretore, if you are tempted to think that Satan

				tor me to throw these pebbles - if such a thought comes
				to you - then you must realize that this thought itself
				is from Satan, who suggests it to make you think there is

				The time appointed for throwing pebbles during the three

				that the Prophet (peace be upon him) threw the pebbles at
				midday or thereafter. This is reported by Ahmad, Ibn

				Al-Baihaqi has reported on the authority of Nafi' that
				Abdullah bin 'Umar used to say "We used not to throw the
				pebbles during the three days until after the sun was
				past the meridkul. Delaying the throwing of pebbles till
				night was disliked. The time for throwing pebbles dul-ing
				the night was until the sunrise of the next day. All
				Imams of Islamic law. except Abu Hanifah, agree on this
				point. Abu Hanifah holds that throwing pebbles before
				midday on the third day is permissible. He based his
				opinion on a rather weak hadith transmitted by Ibn 'Abbas
				which says, "When day breaks on the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah,
				it is permissible to throw one's pebbles and depart from
				Mina (to Makkah)."

			<p>
				It is desirable to stand facing the Qiblah, to praise
				Allah, while supplicating to Him for forgiveness for
				oneself, and for other fellow Muslims. Ahmad and Bukhari
				have reported from Salim bin Abdullah bin 'Umar and he
				from his father that when the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				threw pebbles at the first Jamarah, which is near the
				mosque, he said, Allahu Akbar. Thus he threw seven
				pebbles and each time he said Allahu Akbar. Then he went,
				turned left toward the bottom of the valley. There he
				stood tor quite a long time tacing the direction of
				Qiblah, and raising his hands supplicated to Allah. Then
				he went and threw seven pebbles at the second Jamarah
				saying Allahu Akbar with each throw. Thereafter he went
				to the left of the bottom of the valley, stood there
				facing Qiblah and supplicated to Allah with raised hands.
				Then he went to the Jamarah near Aqabah, threw seven
				pebbles at it, uttering a fakhir with each throw. After
				this he left and did not pause. According to this hadith
				the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not pause after
				throwing pebbles at the Jamarah Al-Aqabah, but he did
				pause after throwing pebbles at the other two Jamarahs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The scholars have in the light of the above hadith
				suggested that after any throwing (of pebbles at the
				Jamarahs) that is not followed by another throwing the
				same day one should not stop (for supplications), but if
				one throwing (of pebbles) is followed by another throwing
				the same day one should stand there for supplications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ibn Majah has reported from Ibn 'Abbas that after
				throwing pebbles at the Jamarah al-Aqabah, the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) used to leave, and not stop (for
				supplications).

				The practice of shaving or clipping hair is affirmed by
				the Qur'an, the Sunnah of the Prophet, and the consensus
				of the community. Says Allah: "Truly did Allah fulfil the
				vision for His Messenger: ye shall enter the Sacred
				Mosque, if Allah wills, with minds secure, heads shaved,
				hair cut short, and without fear." (Qur'an 48.27)
			</p>
			<p>
				Both Bukhari and Muslim have reported that the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) said, "May Allah bless those who
				shaved." The Companions asked him, "O Allah's Messenger,
				what about those who clip their hair short?" Thereupon
				the Prophet (peace be upon him) again said, "May Allah
				bless those who shaved." They repeated their question the
				third time, and again the Prophet said, "May Allah bless
				those who shaved." When they asked him for the fourth
				time, "O Allah's Messenger, what about those who clip
				their hair short?" He said, "And (may Allah bless) those
				who clip their hair short. (It is said that the reason
				for repeating supplication for those who shaved their
				hair is obviously to encourage people to shave rather
				than cut their hair short only because by shaving off
				one's hair one demonstrates one's sincerity and humility
				to Allah without caring for one's physical appearance)
			</p>
			<p>
				Both Bukhari and Muslim also report that the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) shaved his head, and so did a group
				of his Companions, while others only cut their hair
				short.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shaving here means removing hair of the head with a
				razor, etc., or plucking them out. It suffices one,
				however, to remove only as many as three hairs. And
				cutting the hair short means cutting the length of one
				fingertip of the head's hair. The majority of jurists
				disagree concerning this issue.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most scholars hold that shaving or cutting the hair short
				is obligatory, and one failing to do so must slaughter an
				animal to atone for this omission. According to the
				Shafi'i school it is an integral part of Hajj.

				A pilgrim may shave or cut his hair short right after

				Day of Nahr - the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah. If, however, a
				pilgrim has with him animals to be slaughtered then he
				can shave or cut his hair short only after having
				slaughtered these animals.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a hadith reported by Ma'mar bin Abdullah we read that
				the Prophet (peace be upon him) slaughtered his
				sacrificial animal at Mina and said, "He has commanded me
				to shave (my head)." This was reported by Ahmad and
				At-Tabarani.

			<p>
				The time to shave or cut one's hair short while

				after they slaughter them.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the time of shaving or cutting one' s hair short,

		<section heading="On Performing Hajj and 'Umrah: A Brief Summary">
			<p>
				On approaching the miqat (the place fixed for taking on
				ihram), a pilgrim should trim his moustache, cut short
				his hair, clip his finger nails, and take a bath or make
				ablution, wear some perfume, and then don the ihram. He
				should offer a two rak'ah prayer, and then declare his or
				her intention to perform Hajj, or Hajj and 'Umrah, or
				'Umrah only, as the case may be.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wearing ihram and declaring intention for Hajj or 'Umrah
				is an essential part of both, and neither will be correct
				without these.
			</p>
			<p>
				Specifying the kind of Hajj, whether it is if rad (Hajj
				only), tamattu ' (Hajj and 'Umrah combined with a break
				in between), or qiran (Hajj and 'Umrah without a break),
				is not essential. If someone makes an intention of
				performing Hajj without specifying the kind, his ihram
				will still be valid, and he may perform any of the three
				kinds of Hajj.
			</p>
			<p>
				As soon as he enters the state of ihram a pilgrim must
				utter talbiyah loudly, whenever he climbs a hill or goes
				down a valley, meets a group or a person, early in the
				morning, and after every prescribed prayer.
			</p>
			<p>
				When in a state of ihram, a person must avoid sexual
				intercourse and all things that lead to it; he must avoid
				wrangling and useless bickering, nor must he marry or
				join others in marriage.
			</p>
			<p>
				A muhrim must not wear any sewn clothes or shoes that
				cover his feet above his ankles. He must not cover his
				head, nor use any perfume, nor cut his hair or nails, nor
				engage in hunting any game, nor cut trees or grass within
				the Sacred Precincts of Haram.
			</p>
			<p>
				When entering Makkah it is desirable that a pilgrim enter
				from its high iide. if possible. atter taking a bath at
				the Dhi Tawa well in Zahir. Then he should go to the Ka
				bah and enter the Sacred Mosque from the gate called Bab
				As-Salam, while uttering supplications of entry into the
				mosques and observing otheretiquette of entry with
				humility, fear, and talbiyah on his tongue.
			</p>
			<p>
				On seeing the Ka'bah, he should raise his hands and
				supplicate to Allah for His bounties. Then he should
				directly proceed to the Black Stone, kiss it quietly or
				touch it with his hand and kiss the hand. If this is not
				possible and one cannot reach the Black Stone, one may
				just point toward it from a distance.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this one should begin his tawaf around the Ka'bah
				supplicating in words transmitted from the Prophet (peace
				be upon him).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first three rounds it is liked that the (male)
				pilgrim uncover his right shoulder and jog at a slow
				pace. In the remaining rounds he may walk at a normal
				pace. It is sunnah to touch in every round the Yemeni
				Corner and to kiss the Black Stone. Atter completing
				(seven rounds of) the tawafthe pilgrim should go to the
				Station of Ibrahim in compliance with the command of
				Allah "And take the Station of Ibrahim as a place of
				prayer." (Qur'an 2.125) There he should pray two rak'ahs
				of tawaf.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now he should go to the well of Zamzam and drink of its
				water as much as possible. Thereafter the pilgrim goes to
				Al-Multazim and stands there and supplicates for himself
				to Allah for whatever good he may wish for in this world
				and the hereafter. After this he should (if possible) go
				to the Black Stone, and kiss it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then he should approach the (hill of) Safa through the
				As-Safa gate to begin his Sa'i in compliance with Allah's
				words "Behold! Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of
				Allah. So if those who visit the House in the season or
				at other times. should compass them, it is no sin."
				(Qur'an 2.158) He should climb the Safa, look towards
				Ka'bah. and then make supplication to Allah, using one
				transmitted from the Prophet (peace be upon him). After
				this he should climb down and start walking toward the
				(hill of) Al-Marwah as a start of his seven round walk
				between the two hills, while remembering Allah and
				supplicating to Him.
			</p>
			<p>
				On approaching one of the two green markers, he should
				jog to the second green marker. And after that he should
				resume his normal walking speed toward Al-Marwah. Upon
				reaching Al-Marwah he should climb it, turn toward
				Ka'bah, and make supplications and glorify Allah. This
				will complete his one round. Then he should make the
				remaining six rounds in like manner, completing all seven
				rounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Sa'i is an essential (wajib) ritual of Hajj, and any
				pilgrim failing to perform it or a part of it must
				slaughter an animal to atone for this omission. Finally,
				if he is performing a Hajj Tamattu' (Hajj with an 'Umrah
				with a break between the two), he should either shave olf
				his head or trim his hair short. This would release him
				of all the restrictions of the state of ihram, and all
				things that were prohibited to him in that state become
				permissible for him, including sexual intercourse with
				his wife.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those who intend to perform a Hajj Ifrad (Hajj only) or
				Hajj Qiran (Hajj and 'Umrah together without a break)
				they must continue in the state of ihram. On the 8th of
				Dhul-Hijjah those intending to perform Hajj Tamattu' will
				once more resume ihram from their residences and proceed
				to Mina, along with those who had continued in a state of
				ihram, and spend the night there.
			</p>
			<p>
				At sunrise of the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah the pilgrims leave
				for Arafah, and (if possible) stay by the Mosque of
				Namira. There they take a bath and offer Zuhr and 'Asr
				prayers, making Qasr (shortening the prayers) and
				combining them at the earliest time behind an imam. If
				this is not possible then one may pray alone, as best as
				one can, combining and shortening the two prayers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pilgrims' stay at Arafah begins only atter the sun has
				passed its zenith. During this time one should stand by
				the rocks (of Arafah) or as close as possible, because
				this is where the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to
				take his stand. Staying at Arafah is the principal rite
				of Hajj, but climbing the Mount of Mercy is neither a
				sunnah nor should it be attempted.
			</p>
			<p>
				During this stay one should face the direction of Qiblah,
				glorify Allah and remember Him, and supplicate to Him as
				much as possible until nightfall.
			</p>
			<p>
				After nightfall the pilgrims must leave for Muzdalifah,
				and reaching there, offer Maghrib and 'Isha prayers,
				combining them and offering them toward the the end of
				the usual time, and then spend the night there.
			</p>
			<p>
				At dawn the pilgrims stand by Al-Mash'ar al Haram (the
				Sacred Monument), and remember and glorify Allah until it
				is broad daylight. Thereafter they should return to Mina
				after picking up their pebbles from Muzdalifah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Standing by the Sacred Monument is essential (wajib), and
				anyone failing to do so is required to offer a sacrifice
				in atonement.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the sunrise, a pilgrim must throw seven pebbles at
				Jamarah Al-Aqabah. Then he should slaughter his
				sacrificial animal, if possible, shave off or cut his
				hair short. This will release him frolll the restrictions
				of ihram. and he may engage in any normal activity except
				sexual intercourse with his wite.
			</p>
			<p>
				He must then return to Makkah to perform Tawaf Al-Itadah
				an essential part of Hajj, and also known as Tawaf
				Az-Ziyarah. He should perform it in the same manner as he
				had earlier performed Tawaf Al-Qudum. If the pilgrim is
				performing Hajj Tamattu', he must perform a Sa'i after
				this Tawaf Al-Ifadah. For a pilgrim performing Hajj Qiran
				or Ifrad, this second Sa'i is not essential, if on
				arriving in Makkah he had performed a Tawaf Al-Qudum.
			</p>
			<p>
				After this tawaf - Tawaf-Al-Ifadah - a pilgrim may engage
				in all normal lawful activities including sexual
				intercourse with his wife.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pilgrim must now return to Mina and stay overnight
				there. This overnight stay at Mina is essential and for
				abandoning it one must atone by offering a sacrifice.
			</p>
			<p>
				After midday on the 11th of Dhul-Hijjah, the pilgrim must
				throw pebbles at the three Jamarahs, starting with the
				one nearest to Mina, then the middle one, and stand for a
				while invoking and supplicating to Allah. Then he should
				go to the last Jamarah, throw pebbles at it, and leave
				without stopping there. A pilgrim should finish throwing
				pebbles at the three Jamarahs well before the sunset. On
				the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah he should repeat the rites of the
				previous day.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having thrown the pebbles a pilgrim is free either to
				return to Makkah before the sunset of the 12th of
				Dhul-Hijjah, or spend the 13th of Dhul-Hijjah as well in
				Mina, and throw pebbles at the Jamarahs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Throwing pebbles is an essential rite of Hajj and for
				failing to do so one must offer a sacrifice.
			</p>
			<p>
				After returning to Makkah if the pilgrim desires to
				return to his home country he must perform TawafAI-Wida'
				or Farewell Tawaf, which is also an essential rite of
				Hajj. In case he is unable to perform it, and if he has
				not crossed the miqat, he should return to Makkah and
				perform it, or else sacrifice a sheep.
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, the essential rites of Hajj and 'Umrah are:
				declaring ihram from miqat, tawaf, Sa'i, halq (shaving
				one' s hair) or qasr (or cutting one' s hair short). With
				these the rituals of 'Umrah are completed.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the case of Hajj one has to perform certain additional
				rites. The essential rites of Hajj are spending a Day at
				Arafah, throwing pebbles at Jamarahs, Tawaf Al-lfadah,
				staying in Mina, slaughtering an animal, shaving or
				cutting one's hair short. This is a brief summary of all
				the rites of Hajj and 'Umrah.

		<section heading="Al-Ihsar (Or Blockading)">
			<p>
				Al-lhsar (as used in the Qur'an) means blocking the path
				to the House of Allah. Allah says, "And complete the Hajj
				or 'Umrah in the service of Allah. But if you are
				prevented (from completing it) send an offering for
				sacrifice." (Qur'an 2.196)
			</p>
			<p>
				This verse was revealed at the time of Hudaibiah when the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) was prevented from visiting
				the Sacred Mosque. By implication it means being
				prevented from making tawaf in the case of 'Umrah, or
				spending the Day at Arafah and making Tawaf Al-lfadah in
				the case of Hajj.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is disagreement among the scholars, however, on
				what constitutes a state of prevention or blockading.
				Malik and Shafi'i hold that such a state refers to a
				blockade by an enemy, for the verse was revealed about
				the Prophet (peace be upon him) who was blocked from
				performing an 'Umrah. Ibn 'Abbas also holds a similar
				view.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most scholars including the Hanafites and Ahmad, however,
				are of the opinion that a person is deemed blocked when
				he is prevented from approaching the House of Allah, by
				reason of an enemy force (A force of disbelievers or a
				rebel group) or a sickness which could worsen by motion
				or travel, a state of fear (and insecurity), loss of
				provisions, or in the case of a woman, the death of her
				mahram accompanying her, or any other similar cause. Ibn
				Mas'ud even gave a verdict that a man bitten by a snake
				is also considered among the prevented ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				These scholars base their argument on the fact that the
				words "But if you are prevented" used in the above
				Qur'anic verse about the Prophet (peace be upon him) are
				general and are not limited to any specific cause of
				prevention. This is the strongest view on this subject.

		<section heading="Prevented Person to Slaughter a Sheep or a Bigger Animal">
			<p>
				The verse is quite clear in that a prevented person may
				slaughter any animal he is able to afford. Ibn 'Abbas
				reported that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was
				prevented from performing 'Umrah (by the Quraish) he
				shaved his head, consorted with his wives, and
				slaughtered his animal. The next year he performed an
				'Umrah to make up for the year that he had missed. This
				was reported by Bukhari. The majority of scholars in
				light of this hadith hold the view that a prevented
				person must slaughter a sheep, a cow or a camel. Malik,
				however, differs with this opinion and says slaughtering
				an animal is not essential.
			</p>
			<p>
				The author of Fath ul 'Alam remarks, "Malik is right in
				his opinion, because all the Companions of the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) who were prevented with him (at
				Hudaibiyah) did not have animals with them to slaughter
				after they were unable to perform 'Umrah. The Prophet
				(peace be upon him) slaughtered his animal which he had
				brought along with him from Madinah." There is no
				implication of any obligation in the verse. Rather, it is
				the Prophet (peace be upon him) who is referred to in the
				Qur'anic verse (48.25): "They are the ones who denied
				revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and
				sacrificial animals."

				The author of Fath ul 'Alam says: ' The scholars disagree
				concerning the place of slaughter on the Day of Hudaibiah
				whether it was within or outside the Sacred Precincts of
				Haram. Apparently the words of Allah "and they hindered
				you from the Sacred Mosque and sacrificial animals"
				suggest that the animals were slaughtered outside the
				Sacred Precincts of Haram. There are various views
				concerning this. One view - the majority view - is that a
				prevented person may slaughter his sacrificial animal
				within or outside the Sacred Precincts of Haram. Another
				view, the view of the Hanafi School is that he must
				slaughter it within the Sacred Precincts of Haram. A
				third view, the view of Ibn 'Abbas and a group of
				scholars, is that if a prevented person is in a position
				to send his sacrificial animal to the Precincts of Haram
				he must slaughter it there, and only then terminate his
				ihram. If this is not possible then he may slaughter it
				at the place where he is prevented.

				Commenting on the Qur'anic verse "But if you are
				prevented (from completing it) send an offering for
				sacrifice," Ibn 'Abbas said, "If one intended to perform
				either Hajj or 'Umrah, but was prevented from approaching
				the House of Allah, then he must slaughter whatever
				animal he can afford, a sheep or a larger animal."
			</p>
			<p>
				If a person intended to perform the obligatory Hajj (and
				he was prevented), he must make it up later, but if he
				was intending a supererogatory Hajj, he does not have to
				make up for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malik said that he was told that the Prophet (peace be
				upon him) and his Companions came to Hudaibiah, and there
				they slaughtered their animals, shaved their heads,
				terminated their ihram, and resumed their normal course
				of life, without having first made Tawaf of Ka'bah or
				without the sacrificial animals reaching the Ka'bah.
			</p>
			<p>
				Likewise there is no record, according to Bukhari, that
				the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered his Companions to
				make up for their (missed) 'Umrah or return to the Sacred
				Mosque to repeat it, although Hudaibiah is outside the
				Sacred Precincts of Haram.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shafi'i holds that a prevented person may slaughter
				his sacrificial animal at the place he is stopped and
				terminate his ihram and resume his norrnal life. He is
				not required to make up for what he missed, because Allah
				has not mentioned any such thing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ash-Shafi'i adds, "For we know from the recorded reports
				that some of the people who were with the Prophet (peace
				be upon him) at the time of Hudaibiah did not return the
				next year to make up for their missed 'Umrah.
			</p>
			<p>
				They were not forced to stay back for any excuse,
				sickness or worldly business. If making up for the 'Umrah
				were essential the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have
				certainly commanded them to join him and not to stay
				back."
			</p>
			<p>
				Continuing, he further says, "This 'Umrah was called the
				"'Umrah tul Qada (or 'Umrah performed in order to make up
				for the missed 'Umrah)" because of the the dispute
				between the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Quraish,
				and not because it was essential (wajib) and had to be
				made up later by another 'Umrah."

				In the pre-lslamic period the Arabs used to cover the

				retained this tradition. Al-Waqidi has stated that
				Isma'il bin Ibrahim bin Abu Habibah reported from his
				father that in the Days of Ignorance the Ka'bah was
				covered with rugs made of red skin. Later on the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) covered it with Yemeni cloth, while

				first one to cover it was a man from Tubba' of Yemen
				called As'ad al-Himairi.

			<p>
				Ibn 'Umar used to choose the best and most expensive

				Sa'id bin Al-Musayyib reported from Abu Hurairah that the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "You should not
				undertake a special journey to visit any place other than
				the three Mosques: the Sacred Mosque of Makkah, this
				mosque of mine, and Al-Aqsa Mosque (of Jerusalem)." This
				is reported by Bukhari, Muslim, and Abu Daw'ud. In
				another natration the words are "For three mosques a
				special journey may be undertaken: The Sacred Mosque
				(Ka'bah), my mosque, and the mosque of Al-Quds
				(Jerusalem)."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Dharr reported that he asked the Prophet (peace be
				upon him), "O Prophet of Allah, which mosque was built
				first on earth?" The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied,
				"The Sacred Mosque of Makkah." Abu Dharr again asked,
				"Which was next?" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,
				"The Al-Aqsa Mosque." "How long was the period between
				them?" Abu Dharr asked. The Prophet (peace be upon him)
				said, "Forty years. Apart from these, offer your prayers
				anywhere when it is time to pray, although excellence is
				in praying in these mosques."
			</p>
			<p>
				Traveling to these three mosques is prescribed because of
				their special position in Islam. Jabir reported that the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "One prayer in this
				mosque of mine is better than 1,000 prayers offered
				anywhere else except the Sacred Mosque, and one prayer in
				the Sacred Mosque is better than a hundred thousand
				prayers in any other mosque." This was reported by Ahmad
				with a sound chain of authorities.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anas bin Malik reported that the Prophet (peace be upon
				him) said, "Whoever prays forty prayers consecutively in
				my mosque without missing any of the obligatory prayer,
				he will be removed from Hell, from punishment, and from
				hypocrisy." This was reported by Ahmad and At-Tabarani
				with a sound chain. We read in various ahadith that a
				prayer offered in the AlAqsa mosque is five hundred times
				superior (in reward) to one offered in any other mosque,
				except the Sacred Mosque and the Mosque of the Prophet
				(in Madinah).

			<ol>
				<li>
					It is recommended that one should approach the
					Prophet's Mosque calmly and with composure. One
					should wear perfume, put on a nice clean dress
					and enter the mosque with the right foot, and
					say, A'udhu billahil 'azeem wa bi-wajhihil kareem
					wa sultanihil qadeem minashaitanir rajeem.
					Bismillah, Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammadin wa
					aalihi wa sallam, Allahummaghfir li zunubi waftah
					li abwaba rahmatika. "I seek refuge with Allah
					the Supreme with His Noble Face and with His
					Eternal Dominion from the accursed devil. In the
					Name of Allah O Allah! Bless Mohammad his family
					and his followers. O Allah! Forgive my sins and
					open doors of Your mercy for me."
				</li>
				<li>
					It is also recommended to go first to the raudah
					(According to a hadith raudah (literally, a
					garden) is the space in the Prophet's mosque
					between his grave and his pulpit. As is stated in
					the hadith below. The Prophet (peace be upon him)
					died in his house, and that is where he was
					buried) and offer there two rak'ahs as greetings
					to the Mosque with calm and humility.
				</li>
				<li>
					After this one should head toward the grave of
					the Prophet (peace be upon him) face it, and with
					the back to the Qiblah, give greetings of peace
					to the Prophet (peace be upon him), saying:
					Assalamu 'alaika ya rasulallah. Assalamu 'alaika
					ya nabiyallah. Assalamu 'alaika ya khiyrata
					khalqillah min khalqihi. Assalamu 'alaika ya
					khaira khalqillah. Assalamu 'alaika ya
					habiballah. Assalamu 'alaika ya sayyidil
					mursaleen. Assalamu 'alaika ya rasullallah rabal
					'alameen. Assalamu 'alaika ya qa 'idal ghirril
					muhajjaleen. Ash-hadu alla-ilaha illallah, wa
					ash-hadu annaka 'abduhu wa rasuluhu wa ameen uhu
					wa khiyratuhu min khcllyihi, wa ash-hadu annaka
					qad ballaghtar rasalata wa addaital amanata wa
					nasahtal ummata wa jahdta fillahi haqa jihadihi.
					"Peace be on you, O the Messenger of Allah. Peace
					be on you, O, the Prophet of Allah. Peace be on
					you, O, the chosen one of Allah's creation. Peace
					be on you, O, the beloved one of Allah. Peace be
					on you, O, the Chief of the Messengers of
					(Allah). Peace be on you, O, the Messenger of the
					Lord of the universe. Peace be on you, O, the
					Chief of the unique generation. I bear witness
					that there is no God but Allah, and I bear
					witness that you are His slave, messenger,
					trustee, and the chosen one of His creation. I
					bear witness that you indeed delivered the
					message (of Allah). discharged your trust,
					counseled the Muslim community, and strove hard
					tor the cause of Allah."
				</li>
				<li>
					Now moving about a yard to the right, the visitor
					should offer his greetings to Abu Baker
					As-Siddiq, and then moving further another yard
					in the same direction, offer greetings to 'Umar
					bin Al-Khattab.
				</li>
				<li>
					Then facing the direction of Qiblah the visitor
					should supplicate for himself, his family,
					friends, relatives, and the rest of the Muslims,
					and then leave.
				</li>
				<li>
					A visitor should not raise his voice more than
					needed to hear himself. The people in charge
					should prevent others from raising their voices
					gently and politely.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				It is reported that 'Umar bin Al-Khattab saw two men
				raising their voices in the Mosque of the Prophet (peace
				be upon him). At this he told them, "Had I known that you
				are from this city, I would have punished you."
			</p>
			<p>
				Abu Daw'ud reported from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) said, "Do not turn your houses into
				graves, nor make my grave a place of festivity. Send your
				greetings upon me, for your greetings are conveyed to me
				wherever you are." Abdullah bin Hasan saw a man
				frequenting the grave of the Prophet (peace be upon him)
				and making supplications there. Thereupon he told him, O,
				so and so, the Prophet (peace be upon him) has said, 'Do
				not make my grave a place of festivity. but send your
				greetings upon me from wherever you happen to be, for
				your greetings are conveyed to me.' (In this respect)
				there is no difference between you and a man from (a
				distant country like) Andalusia."

				The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to go there, riding
				or on foot, every Saturday and offer a two rak'ah prayer.
				He advised others to do the same, saying, "Whoever makes
				ablutions at home and then goes and prays in the Mosque
				of Quba, he will have a reward like that of an 'Umrah."
				This was reported by Ahmad, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and

				Abu Hurairah reported that the Prophet (peace be upon

				Madinah as a snake returns and comes back to its hole
				(when in danger)."
			</p>
			<p>
				At-Tabarani has reported from Abu Hurairah that the
				Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Madinah is the dome of
				Islam, the abode of faith, the land of migration, and the
				dwelling place of what is lawful and unlawful."
			</p>
			<p>
				'Umar reported that when things became very dear in
				Madinah and the people suffered hardship, the Prophet
				(peace be upon him) said (to the people), "Be patient
				(and of good cheer) and receive the happy news. I have
				blessed your measures, your Sa' and Mudd. So eat in
				groups together. One person's food shall be sufficient
				for two; two people' s for five; and food for four people
				shall be sufficient for five and six people. The
				blessings are upon the community. He who perseveres and
				is patient in its (i.e., of Madinah) times of hardship
				and difficulty, I shall be an intercessor and a witness
				for him on the Day of Judgement. And he who leaves it
				(i.e., Madinah) disliking what is therein (of hardships),
				Allah will replace him with someone better than him.
				Whoever intends evil against it, Allah will cause him to
				be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in
				water." This was reported by Bazzar with a sound chain of
				narration.

				At-Tabarani has reported with a sound chain of narration

				That is why 'Umar prayed to Allah to cause him to die in
